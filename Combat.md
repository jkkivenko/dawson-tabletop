#WIP 

Combat is the most rules-heavy aspect of Dawson. In this Mode, parties are drafted into Initiative - a strict order in which they must act on a given turn. In a Ship-scale combat, this might mean entire ships go one after the other. In Ground-scale battles, this likely means each player taking turns individually. During Combat, players and GMs should respect the abilities and rules granted by their Character so as to keep fights fair and engaging.

The following document is divided into two sections based on the scale of the combat. Most rules specify whether they apply to Ship- or Ground- scale combat, but the GM should make the final call if it is not specified.

During Combat, each party gains 3 actions at the start of their turn. Dawsoneers will usually have a list of actions available to them, granted by their [[Class]], [[Skills]], [[Society]], and [[Physiology]]. NPCs and creatures, on the other hand, usually have a list of abilities from their statblock. All parties have access to the [[Base Actions]], which include things like moving and interacting with items. Parties also have access to other actions if they are in a situation that grants it to them. Most importantly, standing in front of a Spacecraft [[Workstations|Workstation]] grants you an array of actions related to that Workstation. 

Importantly, each party can only use each action once per turn. This means you can't sprint for a whole turn or attack nonstop, which incentivises Dawsoneers and GMs alike to take broad diverse turns while trying to make the most out of their one use of each action.
