#WIP #spacecraft 

# Description

The galaxy is full of Spacecraft of all shapes and sizes, from the tiniest *Orbit*-class personal Spacecraft to massive *Nebula*-class flagships with crews the size of cities and beyond. This document outlines the main classes of Spacecraft and serves as a jumping-off point into the complex task of designing a Spacecraft from the ground up.

Not all Spacecraft have the capacity to travel between stars. Those that can travel interstellar distances faster-than-light are commonly called FTL ships, lightspeed ships, or simply Starships. These are equipped with an FTL Drive, a complex device required for lightspeed travel and beyond. Settled star systems sometimes use non-FTL vessels for cheaper transport across short distances.

# Spacecraft Classes

Spacecraft are broadly classified into 5 classes, with each class corresponding to larger and more powerful craft. Most sensors can tell a Spacecraft's class from a quick scan, allowing Characters to conveniently identify a Spacecraft's general size and capabilities.

## [[Orbit-class]]

![[Orbit-class#^909d4e]]

| Example Vessels | Description |
|---|---|
| [[Escape Pod]] | A small auto-guided capsule capable of carrying a handful of passengers off a doomed vessel or station. If you're in one of these, you'd better hope there's rescue nearby. |
| [[Old Starfighter]] | An antiquated fightercraft which can still pack a punch with its lasers. Capable of atmospheric flight, but not FTL. |
| [[Orbital Ferry]] | A small yet comfortable shuttlecraft capable of ferrying passengers to and from orbit and little else. |
| [[Long-range Shuttle]] | A small yet capable shuttlecraft, equipped for a variety of long-range missions. Capable of landing on planets, attacking with its plasma torpedoes, and going FTL, this shuttle is on the upper end of *Orbit*-class vessels. |
| [[Starfighter]] | A very capable fightercraft with multiple weapon systems, advanced manoeuverability, and a small FTL Drive. |

## [[Escape-class]]

![[Escape-class#^e4b751]]

| Example Vessels | Description |
|---|---|
| [[Interstellar Ferry]] | A medium-sized vessel with a powerful FTL Drive, used for ferrying lots of passengers between stars with well-equipped ports |
| [[Starliner]] | A medium-sized FTL-capable vessel designed for luxury cruising between the stars. |
| [[Freighter]] | A relatively large vessel with a small crew but a large optionally-pressurised cargo bay. |
| [[Private Spacecraft]] | A large personal spacecraft used for travel, hosting parties, and flaunting one's wealth. Some are equipped with weapons and most have FTL Drives, but not all. |

## [[Astro-class]]

![[Astro-class#^d444b4]]

| Example Vessels | Description |
|---|---|
| [[Exploration Vessel]] | A vessel with a crew complement between 5 and 15, used by interstellar coalitions to scout star systems for life, resources, or scientific discoveries. |
| [[Patrol Vessel]] | A versatile military spacecraft with advanced weapon systems and long-range scanners. They are often found around contested borders or planetary blockades. |
| [[Corvette]] | A military spacecraft built for durability and firepower, as well as increased speed over higher-class warships. |
| [[Star Freighter]] | A commercial craft made for carrying goods long distances, potentially through uncertain space. Some are independently operated, but many also see use in convoys or are accompanied by warship escorts. |
| [[Space Yacht]] | An extremely large personal spacecraft used for travel, hosting parties, and flaunting one's wealth. Equipped with an FTL Drive, this vessel is capable of bringing the party anywhere in the sector. |
| [[Science Vessel]] | A vessel equipped with advanced scientific scanners and labs with a crew of scientists. Science Vessels rarely have weapons installed, so they are usually escorted by a more capable vessel. |

## *Constellation*-class

*Constellation*-class vessels are powerful, fast, and expensive. These are the largest vessels most Dawsoneers will see on a regular mission, and they have a reputation befitting their size. *Constellation*-class spacecraft are capable of operating almost indefinitely without stopping at a planet or space station for resupply despite their huge crew complements, and many act as forward operating bases for smaller craft. In combat, a *Constellation*-class warship is a serious increase in power compared to smaller vessels, capable of defeating a flotilla of *Astro*-class warships or countless *Orbit*-class fighters. 

| Example Vessels | Description |
|---|---|
| [[Battle Cruiser]] | The largest warship in a typical fleet, so large and well-defended that attacking one head-on is usually a death sentence. Befitting their large size, Battle Cruisers tend to have almost any service its crew could require. |
| [[Flagship]] | A large flagship designed for deployment on deep-space missions, providing any service from science to defence to relaxation. |

## *Nebula*-class

*Nebula*-class vessels are so enormous and well-defended that even a non-combat *Nebula*-class ship is basically indestructible. These vessels have crew complements in the thousands or tens of thousands, and many can be compared to entire cities in size and function. 

| Example Vessels | Description |
|---|---|
| [[Colony-ship]] | A truly massive vessel which functions more like a space station or city than a vessel. Colony-ships carry up to a million passengers, and are usually trade hubs, travel destinations, or exporters of goods or services. |
| [[Dreadnought]] | The most fearsome warship most citizens have ever heard of. A Dreadnought is a harbinger of destruction, with weapons the size of entire *Astro*-class fleets. When a Dreadnought is about to engage in battle, scavengers come together from across the galaxy for the ensuing scrap buffet. |
| [[Mobile HQ]] | A mothership for smaller warships and a place for Battle Cruisers to restock. The Mobile HQ is truly a forward operating base, and some come installed with entire shipyards to manufacture smaller vessels on the go. |

## *Galaxy*-class

*Galaxy*-class vessels are exceedingly rare. Many only hear of them in folk stories told by untrustworthy individuals, but make no mistake - *Galaxy*-class ships are real, although their power is certainly awesome. The size of small moons with weapons capable of punching clean through other ships, *Galaxy*-class warships are legendary.

No example vessels are provided for the *Galaxy* class, because in a story they tend to function less like a Spacecraft and more like a planet or government. Rather than having Shields and Integrity, *Galaxy*-classes are basically indestructible. GMs should consider running them as setpieces in their campaigns rather than enemies, while Dawsoneers should never attempt to fight one head-on.
