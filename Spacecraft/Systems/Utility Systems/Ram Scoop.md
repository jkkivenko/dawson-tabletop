| Power Draw | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 1 | The ship passively generates antimatter depending on its speed. This is usually enough to refill its Warp Engine within about a day of sublight travel, though this can be improved by flying near nebulae or other interstellar phenomenae. |
| 2 | As 1, but a usual ship fills its Warp Engine within about 16 hours. |
| 3 | As 1, but a usual ship fills its Warp Engine within about 12 hours. |
