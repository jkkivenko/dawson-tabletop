| 1 | The ship gains the capability to detect stellar and planetary phenomena inside its Communications Range. |
| 2 | The ship gains the capability to detect stellar and planetary phenomena inside its Communications Range. It also provides constant information about nearby stars and planets, allowing a Course to be Plotted without the need for another map. |

By diverting Power to the Astrometrics Lab, Dawsoneers can performed precise study of stars, planets, and interstellar phenomena. Its main use is for Plotting Courses, but with more Power it can be used for [[Technobabble]] related to distant objects or predicting the location of a Warping ship.

### A note for GMs

The Astrometrics Lab is the perfect place to set up plot hooks, so be liberal with [[Technobabble]] inside it. Say, for example, a distant star has been detected with high levels of antimatter which could be harvested for Warp fuel, but there's a dense nebula in the way. This could lead to any number of discoveries along the way, so mention the Astrometrics Lab often.
