#WIP #spacecraft #spacecraft-system #utility-system

A matter-antimatter generator which provides more power to a craft. When in operation, the Power of a Spacecraft is increased by the chosen amount.

By using the Divert Power action from an Engineering Workstation, the Power Generation of the Auxiliary Generator can be adjusted. If this results in the Spacecraft not having enough Power to supply the Power Draw of all of its Systems, some of the Systems must have their Power Decreased as usual.

| Power Generation | Effect |
|------------------|--------|
| 1 | N/A |
| 2 | N/A |
| 3 | N/A |
| 4 | Unstable (`10%`) |
| 5 | Unstable (`50%`) |
| 6 | Unstable (`100%`) |

### Unstable

The Auxiliary Generator is pushed beyond its limits. Upon taking Hull Damage, the Auxiliary Generator has the listed chance to meltdown, destroying itself.

The Auxiliary Generator can be used for other purposes with a hefty amount of [[Technobabble]], including venting antimatter, causing an intentional explosion, or boosting a Warp Reactor's field strength. This usually renders it unable to generate Power.
