A beacon capable of transmitting a locator signal across lightyears.

Cost: `??? credits`
Slots: 1

| Power Draw | Communications Range (Long) |
| -----------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | `4 lightyears` |
| 2 | `10 lightyears` |

**Special: The Distress Beacon does not permit Hailing or any kind of Sensors, and only allows Transmitting data containing a simple locator signal. **

By diverting even more Power to the Distress Beacon, it is possible to use [[Technobabble]] to allow for more complex signals to be sent or to allow data flow in the other direction.
