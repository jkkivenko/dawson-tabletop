A docking bay with a forcefield airlock, capable of fitting multiple *Orbit*-class spacecraft inside. 

Cost: `??? credits`
Slots: 6

| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 0 | The shuttle bay's doors are closed, keeping up to 2 *Orbit*-class spacecraft safely within. |
| 1 | As 0, but the shuttle bay's forcefield airlock is operational, keeping the bay pressurised but allowing easy docking and departure. |

Using relatively little [[Technobabble]], the Shuttle Bay's doors can be opened without Power. This usually requires depressurising the bay first.
