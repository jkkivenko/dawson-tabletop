An optionally-pressurised cargo bay with a forcefield airlock for easy access.

Cost: `??? credits`
Slots: 3

| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 0 | The cargo bay's doors are closed. |
| 1 | The cargo bay's forcefield airlock is operational, keeping the bay pressurised but allowing easy loading and unloading. |

Using relatively little [[Technobabble]], the Cargo Bay's doors can be opened without Power. This usually requires depressurising the bay first.
