Landing legs permitting a spacecraft to land on a planetary surface. They do not require Power to run, but an Unpowered Spacecraft might require manual interference in order to extend its Landing Struts.

Landing Struts can be substituted with wheels or skids at no additional cost, providing no mechanical difference but allowing for Spacecraft which fit a specific theme. They can also be substituted for floatation devices, which allow for water landings but not longer permit surface landings.
