| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 1 | The Tractor Beam latches on to an object no larger than `10m x 10m x 10m` within a range of `10km`, allowing it to be moved somewhere else in range. |
| 2 | As 1, but the object can be `15m` in any dimension and the range is `20km` |
| 3 | As 1, but the object can be `50m` in any dimension and the range is `40km` |
| 4 | As 1, but the object can be `100m` in any dimension and the range is `60km` |
| 5 | As 1, but the object can be `300m` in any dimension and the range is `75km` |
| 6 | As 1, but the object can be `500m` in any dimension and the range is `100km` |
| 7 | As 1, but the object can be `700m` in any dimension and the range is `140km` |
| 8 | As 1, but the object can be `1km` in any dimension and the range is `200km` |

Using [[Technobabble]] and additional Power, the Tractor Beam can be reconfigured to target normally invalid targets, boost its range while sacrificing stability, or hold a destroyed craft together temporarily.
