### Glob

A shot with the Glob trait leaves a sticky glob of plasma when it impacts a Hull. On a successful hit to the Hull, the target becomes Globbed with a value equal to the Glob value. At the end of a Globbed target's turn, it takes Plasma damage equal to its Globbed value and the Globbed value decreases by 1.
