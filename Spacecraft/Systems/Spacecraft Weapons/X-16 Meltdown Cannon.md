### Destabilise

A shot with Destabilise causes disruptions in Warp fields, causing them to destabilise. If it successfully huts a target's Hull, all of the target's Powered Warp Reactors become Unpowered for a split second, causing them to reset their Charge Times to 0.

### Fuse

A shot with Fuse fuses Warp Reactor coils, rendering them temporarily useless. If it successfully hits a target's Hull, all of the target's Powered Warp Reactors become fused, reducing their Power Draw to 0 until the listed amount of time is spent repairing them.

### Meltdown

A shot with Meltdown generates destructive ripples through Warp fields, causing catastrophic cascade meltdowns in a Powered Warp Reactor. If it successfully hits a target's Hull, all of the target's Powered Warp Reactors are completely destroyed, leaving only a hollow radioactive husk in their place.
