### Reflect

A Shield with Reflect inverts the polarity of incoming laser fire and reflects it back at its target. On a successful Laser hit to the Shields, it is reflected the listed percentage of the time. A reflected shot targets where it came from, potentially damaging its own ship. If the percentage fails, the shot targets the shields as normal.
