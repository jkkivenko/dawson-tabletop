### Drain

A shield with Drain sucks Power directly from an enemies Lasers. If it is successfully hit by an enemy's Laser Weapon, the Laser Weapon acts as though its power draw were lowered by the listed amount down to a minimum of 0 until the Surge Shield's Spacecraft's next turn, though its actual power draw remains the same. For the same duration, the Surge Shield's Spacecraft gains additional power equal to the amount lost in effect by the target.
