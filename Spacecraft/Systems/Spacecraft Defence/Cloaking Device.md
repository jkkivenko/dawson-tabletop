### Scramble

The Cloaking Device's Spacecraft's silhouette becomes fuzzy and difficult to predict by enemies' targeting sensors. The Spacecraft's Evasion chance increases by the listed amount.

### Cloak

The Cloaking Device's Spacecraft becomes completely invisible to the naked eye and targeting sensors, although certain traces of a cloaked Spacecraft can still be detected using scientific scanners or sufficiently powerful sensors. The Spacecraft becomes invisible to any Ship without scientific instruments, and those with scientific instruments need to have more than the listed amount of Power diverted to their instruments to detect the cloaked Spacecraft. If an enemy ship succeeds in diverting enough power, the Cloaking Device's Spacecraft still gains `+25%` Evasion.
