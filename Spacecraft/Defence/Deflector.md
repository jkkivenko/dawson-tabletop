**Special: The Deflector shield can only defend against one target at a time.**

### Action: Deflect

**Requirement: You are operating a Tactical Workstation**

You target the Deflector shield to defend against a different threat. That target's attacks now target this Shield, but all other targets can bypass the Shield and hit the Hull directly. These effects last until Deflect is used again.
