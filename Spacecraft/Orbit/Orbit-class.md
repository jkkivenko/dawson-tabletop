# Description

*Orbit*-class Spacecraft are the smallest spacefaring vessels capable of carrying lifeforms. They usually only carry one pilot and a small number of passengers, if any at all. That's not to say they have no place in a Dawsoneer's arsenal - *Orbit*-class Spacecraft are often carried by larger vessels to provide a quick escape, a handy offensive option, or a means of shuttling passengers to and from a planetary surface. ^909d4e
