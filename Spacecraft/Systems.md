# Description

Without Systems, a Spacecraft is no better than a hunk of scrap. Systems are what allow a Spacecraft to fly, fight, become invisible, defend against incoming weapons, and go to Warp. However, each System takes up one or more System Slots on a Spacecraft. These System Slots are a hot commodity, so make sure to only install Systems which benefit your craft!

Additionally, many Systems draw Power. Power is provided by the Ship's Hull (or Auxiliary Reactors, which can be found under the Utility section) and can be allocated or reallocated to Systems throughout the ship from an Engineering Workstation. Since some Systems aren't always necessary, smart spacefarers can effectively use more Systems than they can provide power to.

Most Spacecraft need an [[#Engines|Engine]] to move at sublight speeds. Beyond that, [[#Warp Reactors]], [[#Weapons Systems]], [[#Defence Systems]], and [[#Utility Systems]] can be installed.

# Weapons Systems

Weapons allow your Spacecraft to attack. They're essential for warships and fightercraft, but many civilian craft forego weapons to make room for other Systems.

 There are are 5 types of weapon: Laser, Plasma, Missile, Kinetic, and Repulsor, with further distinctions inside each category. Gunners can make especially good use of Spacecraft Weapons by operating a Tactical Workstation, but anyone can fire Weapons automatically.

All Spacecraft Weapons are listed below:

| Weapon | Type | Slots | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| [[Small Laser]] | Laser | 1 | A small laser designed for blasting asteroids and debris out of the path of a small spacecraft. |

# Defence Systems

Defence Systems include shields, extra armour, point defence turrets, and forcefield-stabilised bulkheads. They allow Ships to take more of a beating, which can be useful for warships and civilian vessels alike.

All Defence Systems are listed below:

| System | Type | Slots | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| [[Deflector]] | Shield | 1 | A targetable shield which can only defend against one enemy at a time. |
| [[Armour]] | Armour | 1 | Durable metal alloys layered onto the hull. |

| [[Surge Shield]] | Shield | 6 | A shield capable of draining power from laser or plasma fire. |
| [[Structural Integrity Matrix]] | Armour | 6 | Electrically-charged structural plating which draws power to increase durability. |
| [[Electrorepulsor]] | Shield | 9 | An extremely power-hungry shield, but its resistance is unmatched. |
| [[Titanium Alloys]] | Armour | 9 | Layers upon layers of titanium alloys which protect the hull and reinforce other systems. |

# Engines

Though not strictly necessary, pretty much every Spacecraft needs an Engine. Engines allow Spacecraft to manoeuvre at sub-light speeds, which is necessary for planetary landings and avoiding obstacles. It also provides a tactical advantage in combat, so many warships have sub-light engines in addition to Warp Reactors.

Pilots can make especially good use of Spacecraft Engines by operating a Piloting Workstation, but anyone can fly a Ship.

All Spacecraft Engines are listed below:

| Engine | Type | Slots | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| [[Chemical Thruster]] | Chemical | 1 | A cheap rocket engine which guzzles rocket fuel. |
| [[Ion Thruster]] | Ion | 1 | An ion engine which uses power for efficient flight. |
| [[G-force Engine]] | Chemical | 2 | A powerful rocket engine, but not cheap to run. |
| [[Impulse Drive]] | Repulsor | 3 | An expensive, fast engine which uses antimatter and power for fuel. |
| [[Ion Drive]] | Ion | 3 | A large ion-powered engine assembly. |
| [[Rocket Drive]] | Chemical | 3 | A large but powerful rocket nozzle. |
| [[Xenon Ring]] | Ion | 4 | An extremely efficient ion engine. |
| [[Repulsor Nacelles]] | Repulsor | 4 | Extremely fast nacelles mounted on the sides of a craft. |
| [[PM-1]] | Chemical | 6 | An extremely large assembly of rocket nozzles, piping, and fuel lines. |
| [[Radiation Cycle Turbines]] | Ion | 6 | Huge ion turbines which consume power to move a ship very efficiently. |
| [[Extradimensional Repulsor Manifold]] | Repulsor | 6 | Extremely fast engines which consume remarkably little power but interfere destructively with warp reactors. |

# Warp Reactors

The Warp Reactor is what allows Spacecraft to reach faster-than-light speeds. Rather than accelerating a vessel, the Warp Reactor simply moves a Spacecraft from point A to point B, so passengers feel no disturbance. Travelling at Warp speed causes distant stars in your path to stretch into infinitely thin lines, while anything behind you becomes invisible as its light cannot reach you.

Keep in mind that Warp Speed uses a logarithmic scale, with Warp 0 being the speed of light and Warp 1 being 10 times the speed of light. Even a small increase in Warp Speed can decrease travel times significantly!

All Warp Reactors are listed below:

| Reactor | Maximum Warp | Slots | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| [[Jump Drive Mk I]] | 2.11 | 1 | A tiny warp reactor only capable of running for 24 hours at a time. |
| [[Warp Reactor Mk I]] | 1.76 | 1 | A small warp reactor which can run for extended periods. |
| [[Warp Reactor Mk II]] | 2.56 | 4 | A medium-sized warp reactor which allows for interstellar travel in a matter of days. |
| [[Jump Drive Mk II]] | 3.23 | 3 | A small warp reactor which provides short bursts of speed. Sometimes installed in addition to larger reactors. |
| [[Warp Reactor Mk III]] | 3.72 | 6 | A large warp reactor suited for deep-space missions. |
| [[Warp Reactor Mk IV]] | 4.70 | 10 | An extremely large and powerful warp reactor, capable of sustaining warp 4.7 for days at a time. |
| [[Jump Drive Mk III]] | 6.43 | 11 | An extremely powerful jump drive. If it could run continuously, it could cross the galaxy in two weeks. |
| [[Graviton Accelerator Drive]] | Variable | 8 | A unique type of reactor which allows for incredibly fast travel towards the galactic core, but is useless going the other direction. |

# Utility
