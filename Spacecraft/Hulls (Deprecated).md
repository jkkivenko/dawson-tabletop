# Description

Every Craft needs a Hull. This is the overall body of the craft, including rooms, airlocks, wings, life support, power plants, access tunnels, and bulkheads. This determines your Spacecraft's Class, Size, Hull Integrity, Crew Capacity, Power, Communications Range, and number of Installation Slots. 

The Hull is the most important part of the Spacecraft since it keeps the atmosphere in and the vacuum out. If a Spacecraft's Hull Integrity reaches 0, it is completely destroyed and any crew still aboard is killed (unless they happen to be wearing Exosuits). Generally, a better Hull means a better craft.

Feel free to create your own Hulls using the existing ones as a guide. Keep in mind that more System Slots and Power can make a craft significantly more powerful, so this should be done with caution and a corresponding increase in Cost. 

Most Hulls have pre-installed Systems. These Systems don't take up System Slots but they generally can't be uninstalled without costly modifications to the craft.

# *Galaxy*-class

It rarely makes sense to think about *Galaxy*-class Spacecraft in the same way as smaller craft, since *Galaxy*-class craft are basically entire planets. As a rule of thumb, they generally cost tens of billions of credits and are the size of small moons. Integrity, Crew Capacity, Power, and Systems don't really make sense to prescribe since these Spacecraft are never directly assaulted and have a nearly limitless supply of Power, although Systems can be prescribed to certain segments of the Spacecraft (such as [[Point-defence Turret|Point-defence Turrets]] defending an access port).
