# Description

A mobile science lab which allows for focused study of scientific samples.

By diverting Power to the Science Lab, advanced study of scientific samples can be performed with extreme precision. With small amounts of Power, this includes determining the chemical makeup of a sample, detecting life signs, measuring radiation and particle emissions, and activating devices. With more Power, rigorous experimentation can be performed, like subjecting it to extreme radiation, setting up containment forcefields, or building scientific devices. The Science Lab relies heavily on [[Technobabble]] in order to be useful.

### A Note for GMs

The Science Lab is the perfect place to set up plot hooks, so be liberal with the [[Technobabble]] inside it. Say, for example, a being made of pure energy has stowed away aboard the ship, and it has been isolated to the Science Lab using forcefields. However, when incoming weapon's fire prompts the ship to divert power to Shields, the being escapes containment. This can setup an entire story about tracking down the being, fending off the attackers, and dealing with the unexpected consequences of having an energy being aboard your vessel.
