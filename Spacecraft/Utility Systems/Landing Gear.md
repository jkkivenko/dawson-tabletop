# Description

Extendable Landing Gear which permit a Spacecraft to land on a planetary surface. They do not require Power to work, but unpowered Landing Gear might require manual intervention to extend properly if they're stowed.

Cosmetically, Landing Gear can take the form of extendable legs, deployable wheels, or folding skids.  

# Effect

The Spacecraft can perform landings, provided it meets the other requirements.
