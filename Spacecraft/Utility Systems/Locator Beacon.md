# Description

A beacon installed in a Spacecraft which transmits a locator signal over long distances. Its main purpose is to help rescue ships find a downed Spacecraft, but it can also be used for hidden caches, making rendezvous in deep space, or sending out a distress call.

# Effects

When Powered, the Ship's Communications become the following:

**Special: The Locator Beacon's increased Comms Range does not permit Hailing, any kind of Sensors, or any functions other than Transmitting a simple locator signal.**

| Power Draw | Communications Range (Long) |
| -----------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | `1,000,000,000 km` |
| 2 | `1 ly` |
| 3 | `2 ly` |
| 4 | `3 ly` |
| 5 | `4 ly` |
| 6 | `5 ly` |
| 7 | `7 ly` |
| 8 | `10 ly` |

By diverting more Power to the Locator Beacon, it is possible to use [[Technobabble]] to allow for more complex signals to be sent or to allow data flow in the other direction.
