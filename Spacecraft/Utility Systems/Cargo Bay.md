# Description

An optionally-pressurised cargo bay with heavy mechanical doors and a forcefield airlock for easy access.

# Effects

| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 0 | The Ship's Cargo Capacity is increased by `100 tonnes`. |
| 1 | The Cargo Bay's forcefield airlock is operational, keeping the bay pressurised but allowing easy loading and unloading. |

Using relatively little [[Technobabble]], the Cargo Bay's doors can be forced open without Power. This usually requires depressurising the bay first.
