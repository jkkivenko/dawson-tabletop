Sensors capable of detecting subatomic particles of all kinds, from regular atoms and gas clouds to antimatter, dark matter, and other unknown physical phenomena.

| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 1 | The ship gains the capability to detect exotic matter using Sensor Status. This includes antimatter, tetryons, tachyons, chronitons, thorons, and most other -ons. |

By diverting even more Power to the Gravimetric Sensor, it's possible to increase precision and detect more exotic kinds of matter. With even more Power, it's possible to emit exotic matter or perform other [[Technobabble]] related to subatomic particles.
