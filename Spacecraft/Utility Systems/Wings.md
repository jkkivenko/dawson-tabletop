# Description

Wings and aerodynamic bulkheads extend to the side of your Spacecraft, allowing for more speed and control during atmospheric flight. 

# Effect

This Spacecraft gains a `+10m/s` bonus to its Speed when it is within an atmosphere. This bonus still applies if its Engines are unpowered, though it cannot gain altitude in this case.
