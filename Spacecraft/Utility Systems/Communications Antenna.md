# Description

Sensors with a large communications range. Antennae can be installed on all kinds of craft, from scanner probes to military vessels, in order to increase the range at which ships can be hailed, threats can be detected, and areas can be scanned.

# Effects

The Spacecraft's Communications become the following:

| Power Draw | Communications Range (Short) | Communications Range (Long) |
| -----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0 | `5,000km` | `50,000km` |
| 1 | `10,000km` | `100,000km` |
| 2 | `30,000km` | `300,000km` |
| 3 | `50,000km` | `500,000km` |
| 4 | `70,000km` | `700,000km` |
