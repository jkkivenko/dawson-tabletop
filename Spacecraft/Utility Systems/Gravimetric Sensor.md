# Description

Carefully tuned experiments capable of scanning for stars, planets, and cosmological anomalies.

# Effects

| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 1 | The ship gains the capability to detect gravimetric phenomena using Sensor Status. This includes stellar and planetary observations and interstellar anomalies. |

By diverting even more Power to the Gravimetric Sensor, it's possible to increase precision and detect hidden gravimetric phenomena. With even more Power, it's possible to emit Gravimetric radiation or perform other [[Technobabble]] related to gravity, stars, planets, or interstellar phenomena.
