# Description

A docking port for a huge cargo container. Rather than loading cargo in a bay, this universal docking port can use its tractor beam and docking clamps to hitch up many types of cargo container without manual intervention. It is still possible to access the inside of most containers through the docking port, although it might be a tight squeeze. 

# Effects
