# Description

The Docking Bay has been augmented with quick-deploy magrails, repair bays, and compact folding mechanisms in order to fit more *Orbit*-class Spacecraft inside. 

# Effects

The Docking Bay's effects become the following:

| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 0 | The fighter hangar's doors are closed, keeping up to 6 *Orbit*-class spacecraft safely within. |
| 1 | As 0, but the fighter hangar's forcefield airlock and quick-deploy magrails are operational, allowing fighters to be deployed as an action from the Tactical Workstation. |

Using relatively little [[Technobabble]], the Fighter Hangar's doors can be opened without Power. This usually requires depressurising the hangar first.
