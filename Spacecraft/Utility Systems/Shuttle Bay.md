# Description

A docking bay with heavy mechanical doors and a forcefield airlock, capable of fitting multiple *Orbit*-class spacecraft inside. 

# Effects

| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 0 | The shuttle bay's doors are closed, keeping up to 4 *Orbit*-class spacecraft safely within. |
| 1 | As 0, but the shuttle bay's forcefield airlock is operational, keeping the bay pressurised but allowing easy docking and departure. |

Using relatively little [[Technobabble]], the Shuttle Bay's doors can be opened without Power. This usually requires depressurising the bay first.
