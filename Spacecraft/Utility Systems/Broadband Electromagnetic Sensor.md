# Description

Optical telescopes capable of observing the far electromagnetic spectrum.

# Effects

The Spacecraft gains the following:

| Power Draw | Effect |
| -----------|--------|
| 1 | The ship gains the capability to detect electromagnetic emissions using Sensor Status. This includes visual phenomena, radio waves, x-ray and gamma waves, and anything in between. |

By diverting even more Power to the Broadband Electromagnetic Sensor, more precise measurements can be made. With even more Power and some smart configurations, the Broadband Electromagnetic Sensor can be configured to emit electromagnetic radiation bursts or other [[Technobabble]] related to light emissions.
