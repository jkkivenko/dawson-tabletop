# Description

*Escape*-class Spacecraft occupy a middle ground between *Orbit*- and *Astro*-class vessels. They tend to be capable of FTL travel, but not capable of providing for a large crew or defending themselves. *Escape*-class vessels are most commonly seen as merchant freighters, personnel transports, starliners, or luxury vehicles. ^e4b751
