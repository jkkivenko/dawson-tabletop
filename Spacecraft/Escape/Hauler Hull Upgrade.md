#WIP #hull-upgrade #escape

# Description

Certain *Escape*-class vessels need more capacity than a Cargo Bay or Passenger Cabin can provide for transporting lots of people or cargo long between stars. These transports make up for their lack of luxury with size - think hauler, not star cruise.

## Hull

Size: `50m x 26m x 26m`
Integrity: `166`
