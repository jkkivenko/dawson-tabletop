#WIP #weapon #missile 

An FTL-capable torpedo which destabilises its own FTL Drive upon reaching its target. It is essentially an *Oribit*-class Spacecraft (and can be treated as such for certain effects) equipped with its own remote guidance systems and astronomical sensors.

Upon exiting FTL, it only gives its target about 60 seconds until it detonates. Any target within `100,000 km` is hit by its explosion.
