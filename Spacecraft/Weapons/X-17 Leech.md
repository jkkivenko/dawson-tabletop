### Leech

A shot with Leech drains Power directly from a target's Shields. If it successfully hits a target's Shields, the hit Shield acts as though its power draw were lowered by the listed amount down to a minimum of 0 until the Leech's Spacecraft's next turn, though its actual power draw remains the same. For the same duration, the Leech's Spacecraft gains additional power equal to the amount lost in effect by the target.
