# Introduction

Amid sparking electronics and blaring alarms, a dozen bodies lie motionless on the bridge of a Spacecraft. The computer's voice gives alerts to deaf ears:

"Warning, shield integrity at 0%. Hull integrity at 34%. Weapons systems: offline. Warp reactor: offline. Ion drive: offline. Emergency generator at 12% output. Life support at 14%."

The emergency fire suppression system comes online as the bridge starts to fill with smoke. The alarms become quiet as the foaming fire extinguisher fills the air. Eventually, the computer seems satisfied that the fires have been put out and the alarms fade.

"Recommended action: return to Spacedock 45."

That would be a good recommendation, if anyone were alive to hear it. As the last of the foam dissipates and the final sparks fizzle out, the bridge becomes silent. 

"Recommended action: repair warp reactor and return to Spacedock 45."

...

"Recommended action: repair deck 2 hull breach and return to Spacedock 45."

...

"Recommended action: repair ion drive-"

A hand on the Communications Workstation silences the alert. It was getting annoying anyway. Slowly standing, an android looks around the ruined bridge. It searches its databank for an explanation, but none arrives. What happened here? Why is it on the bridge of a starship, and why is nobody else moving?

But wait, someone else is moving! Anxious to find any survivors, the android checks the pulse of a human lying next to it. Dead. It's wearing a uniform - if the android had to guess, it looks like a military engineer's uniform. The android realises it's wearing the same uniform. Was this human a colleague? A friend?

The moving body stands up. It makes a sound like metal screeching against glass when it moves. Another android. A third android stands in front of the weapons terminal, and a fourth begins to make noise from underneath a collapsed bulkhead.

Wordlessly, the three androids move to help their trapped crewmate. It would seem like the four of them are the only survivors aboard this ship. The first android makes a noise like a garbage disposal clearing its throat, then speaks.

"Where... am I?"

The other androids seem to ponder this question, before one responds.

"Unknown. What is your designation?"

"Unknown."

The android in the engineering uniform takes a concerned glance over at the other three.

"You are damaged. Report to the engineering lab for repairs."

"Where is the engineering lab?"

"Deck 2."

"Where is that?"

"Unknown."

...

After exploring the ship, the four of you quickly realise that every organic crewmember is dead. Their cause of death seems to vary: some died from rapid depressurisation, others radiation, and some even have clear evidence of laser burns on their uniforms. The bridge was heavily damaged in an explosion, and the warp reactor and engineering lab are exposed to space.

With the tools you find and a crew manifest, you realise that you're the only four androids on the crew - and your memory has been completely erased.
