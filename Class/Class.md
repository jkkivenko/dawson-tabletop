There are 5 Classes in Dawson: [[Commander]], [[Scientist]], [[Engineer]], [[Gunner]], and [[Pilot]]. These represent the characterâ€™s archetype, not necessarily their rank or position on a starship.

When building a Character, you can pick one class. When you gain Class Tree Points, allocate those points into the Class Tree specified by your class.
