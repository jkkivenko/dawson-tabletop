 Whether out of respect or fear your allies find it’s usually a good idea to do what you tell them to do. Using your Orders, your allies push themselves to go beyond their usual limits to get your commands done. When you take this Leadership Style, you gain the Eyes Up! Commander Action and the Make it Snappy! and Focus! Actions.

### Action: Step to it!

You give a stern command, coaxing an ally to push beyond their limits to complete an action. Chance to give an extra action but also if you use it again it might cause a loss of an action.

### In Charge enables:

[[Eyes Up!]]
[[That's an Order!]]
