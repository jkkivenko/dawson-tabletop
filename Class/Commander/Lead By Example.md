You are a reassuring presence on the battlefield or on the bridge thanks to your unwavering confidence - whether it's warranted or not. You gain the We're In This Together! action.

### Action: We’re In This Together!

You show your allies how it’s done, reassuring them with your own confidence and dedication. Take an action that requires you make a d20 roll. Until the start of your next turn, if an ally takes the same action (or a similar action which uses the same type of check, at the GM's discretion), they can choose to use your roll's result to determine the outcome of their action instead of making their own roll. Your ally must declare whether they intend to use this effect before making their own roll.

### Lead By Example enables:
