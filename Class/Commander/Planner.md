#WIP #commander

You are a prescient tactician, assisting your allies with carefully concocted plans. You gain the All According to Plan Commander Action, the Here’s the Plan! action, and the Saw This Coming! Leadership Feature.

### Action: Here’s the Plan!

You strategically plan a mission, playing on the strengths of your allies to ensure everything goes according to plan. Once per day, decide on a Mission Brief and list 2 Mission Tactics. Next, decide on a target for the Mission Brief and pick a Target for each Mission Tactic. Players get a bonus whenever one of their actions would contribute to the completion of the Mission Brief or a Mission Tactic. If an action would contribute to the completion of both the Brief and an Tactic, use only the highest bonus. Your Mission Brief and Mission Tactics' effects end when the Mission Brief is completed or after 2 hours, whichever happens first.
