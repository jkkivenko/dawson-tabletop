# Introduction

The Commander provides a beacon for their allies in a dizzying galaxy. Whether through coordination or pure confidence, the Commander always has control over the situation. On a battlefield, this might mean rallying their allies. On a starship, this might mean giving orders and making crucial decisions. The rest of the time, it probably means taking care of the crew so they can work together when it matters most.

# Commander Abilities

Your party turns to you in times of need. You are full of wisdom and strength (or dex) and medium con. Also, you can use martial weapons or something. 

When a battle breaks out, you’re the first to act. You gain a bonus to initiative rolls or something. Additionally, immediately before initiative is rolled, you can use the Commander Action listed below or one you've gained from another source. 

### Commander Action: I’m Warning You!

You realise combat is inevitable, and try to get one last word in before the fighting starts. You attempt to Intimidate an enemy within 10 metres or something.

## Commander enables:

[[Lead By Example]]
