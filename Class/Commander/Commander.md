# Description

As a Commander, your job is to keep a crew working together. You give orders, talk to your crew, and make tactical decisions to help your crew in combat. You might be a level-headed leader who your crew looks up to, a gung-ho daredevil who shoots first and asks questions later, or a clever underdog who uses tricks and careful plans to somehow come out on top.

Regardless of your style, you're a leader who holds your crew together with Commands, special actions which change how you and your crew react to dangerous situations.

# Effects

When you take the Commander Class, you immediately gain the [[Diplomatic Knowledge]] and [[Space Savant]] [[Skills|Skill Abilities]]. Additionally, you gain the On My Mark! Command.

### Commands

Commands are special actions which can only be used at the start of combat. You can choose to use a number of Commands equal to your Command Limit immediately after Initiative is rolled. Commands usually specify their effects up to your Command Range. If your allies leave this range or combat ends, the Command and its effects end.

Command Limit: `1`
Command Range: `10m`

## Command: On My Mark!

Using a whistle, hand signal, or coded phrase, you can indicate to your crew that the situation is about to change. After your crew roll Initiative, any ally within your Command Range can choose to use your Initiative value, moving their turn directly after yours.
