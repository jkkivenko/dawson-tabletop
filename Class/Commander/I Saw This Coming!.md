#WIP #commander

When something goes awry, you're one step ahead. Perhaps unbeknownst to your allies, you set up a contingency plan for when things go wrong. When you gain this feature, pick a Contingency from the list below. You gain the Contingency Plan action. At level 5 or something, you gain another contingency plan from the list.

#### Action: Contingency Plan
You put your contingency plan into effect, throwing the established plan to the wind. When you use this action, activate the effect of your chosen Contingency. If you have multiple Contingencies, you choose which one to activate whenever you use Contingency Plan. If you have a Mission Brief active, it and its associated Mission Tactics end after activating your Contingency's effects.

| Contingency | Effect |
|---|---|
| Emergency Beam-out | You packed a teleporter beacon that you can throw up to 30 metres. You and your allies are immediately Teleported to where it lands (or a nearby location if that location is occupied). |
| Old Friend | You called in a favour from an old friend, who shows up just when things go south. Appearing out of nowhere in an Old Starfighter, your old friend can help you fight or take you to safety. |
| Let's Talk This Out | You make a last-ditch effort to resolve things peacefully. You immediately make a convince check or something. |
| Self-destruct Sequence | You activate a secret self-destruct sequence you had installed in you and your allies' weapons. Each ally's weapon gains the effects of a Plasma Grenade if thrown or something. |
