# Description

The best laid plans of mice and men rarely stand up to a power surge in the ion manifold - and that's why you specialise in improvising when the going gets tough. You commands allow you to regain the upper hand in unexpected situations and turn the tables on cocky enemies.

# Effects

You gain the Change of Plans! Command:

## Command: Change of Plans!

Your crew knows to trust your snap judgements. At the start of your turn, designate a target - a lifeform, an object, or just a point of interest; you and allies within your Command Range gain a `+5%` Accuracy bonus to all actions affecting that target.

You cannot designate the same target two turns in a row.
