# Prerequisites

[[Scout Drone]]

# Description

Your Scout Drones become much more capable, allowing you to find much more information with less effort.

# Effects

Your Scout Mode Drones have their Range increased even further and gain the following actions and abilities:

Range: `120m`

#### Action: Cloak

For the next `60 seconds` this drone becomes completely invisible to the naked eye and simple sensors, although certain traces of a cloaked Drone can still be detected using scientific scanners or sufficiently powerful sensors.

#### Passive: Always Watching

Spy Drones are always scanning. The effects of Scout become permanent, instead of wearing off when the Drone moves.
