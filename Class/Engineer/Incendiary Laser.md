# Prerequisites

Laser Turret

# Description

You've tweaked your Laser Turret to fire higher-energy beams capable of igniting targets.

# Effects

When your Laser Turret lands an attack on a target, the target is ignited. It becomes Burning (`8`). A Burning enemy takes the listed amount of damage at the end of its turn, then reduces its Burning value by 4.
