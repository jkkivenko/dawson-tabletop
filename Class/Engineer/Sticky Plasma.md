# Prerequisites

Plasma Turret

# Description

With a couple of small tweaks to your Plasma Turret, you're able to sacrifice some damage potential to slow down targets considerably.

# Effects

When you deploy your Plasma Turret, you choose whether it should have its normal Attack or the following Attack:

#### Action: Attack

Type: Plasma
Range: `26 metres`
Accuracy: `75%`
Damage: `13-18` + Sticky

##### Sticky

An attack with Stick leaves a sticky glob of plasma on its target. On a successful hit, the target becomes Stuck. A Stuck target whose size is roughly the same as a human has its Speed reduced to `1m/s`. At the end of a Stuck target's turn, it becomes no longer Stuck.
