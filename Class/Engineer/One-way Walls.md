#WIP #engineer 

# Description

You have tweaked your Deployable Walls' holo-projectors to allow passage through them, but only in one direction.

# Effects

Objects, people, and weapons fire can pass through your Deployable Walls but only in one direction. When you Reorient your Deployable Wall, you must also choose which side can be passed through.
