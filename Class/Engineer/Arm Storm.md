# Description

You're able to whip your many arms around to create a devastating storm of arms, metal, and and claws. Anyone, including your allies, should think twice before coming near you.

# Effects

You gain the Arm Storm action.

## Action: Arm Storm

You whirl your arms around in a `6m` radius. Enemies and allies within the radius take `10` Kinetic damage when you use this ability, when they enter the radius for the first time on their turn, or when they start their turn within the radius.

This effect lasts until the start of your next turn or until you dismiss it.
