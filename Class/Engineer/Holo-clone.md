## Action: Create Holo-clone

**Requirement: You do not already have a Holo-clone**

With a command from your Holo-visor, you bring a simple artificial intelligence into existence to control a newly created Holo-clone. It can see and hear, but it cannot speak nor interact with the physical world.

By spending one action, you can command your Holo-clone to move or act a certain way. It cannot attack or interact with objects. If you do not give it a command, it acts of its own limited free will.

Your Holo-clone obeys your verbal commands and commands issued from your Holo-visor unquestioningly, and it tries to be helpful to your allies. It has minimal self-awareness, though it attempts to avoid danger in order to preserve its ability to fulfil its purpose.

When you have your Holo-suit active, you are visually indistinguishable from the Holo-clone. Enemies who do not know you can rarely tell the two of you apart, though clever or familiar opponents might be able to notice differences.

If your Holo-clone takes any damage, or if you do not command it for more than 30 seconds, it disappears. You can also dismiss a Holo-clone at any time.

## Action: Clone Spacecraft

**Requirement: You are operating an Engineering Workstation and do not already have a Clone Spacecraft created.**

Using similar technology, you can create a clone of your Spacecraft instead of yourself. It is a perfect replica of your Spacecraft, but it cannot interact with the physical world and does not move on its own.

By spending one action while operating an Engineering Workstation, you can command your Clone Spacecraft to move or act a certain way. It cannot attack or interact with objects. If you do not give it a command, it matches course with your Spacecraft.

By spending one action while operating a Communications Workstation, others can attempt to scan your Clone Spacecraft to determine it is fake, though your Clone Spacecraft has a `66%` Evasion chance. On a failed scan, the scanner returns unconclusive readings. While your Clone Spacecraft is active, your Spacecraft has a `66%` Evasion chance against scans to determine if it is real. On a failed scan, the scanner returns unconclusive readings as well.
