# Prerequisite

[[Shielded Turret]]

# Description

You've redesigned your Deployable Turret from the ground up, giving it the capability to fire concentrated Repulsor blasts instead of kinetic rounds.

# Effects

When you deploy your turret, you choose whether it should have its normal Attack or the following Attack:

#### Action: Attack

Type: Repulsor
Range: `48 metres`
Accuracy: `95%`
Damage: `18-22` + Knockback (`2`)

##### Knockback

A shot with Knockback imparts kinetic energy when it impacts an enemy. If it successfully hits a target, the target is pushed the listed number of metres away.
