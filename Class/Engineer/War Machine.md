# Prerequisites

[[Mounted Machine Gun]]
[[Exoskeleton]]

# Description

By adding even more bulk, seats, and weaponry, your armour has become a true weapon of war.

# Effects

You gain additional Integrity and Hardness, as well as the abilities and actions detailed below.

Integrity: `+50`
Hardness: `+10`

## Passive: Personnel

Your armour has integrated seats, allowing four riders to each use one of your Rider Actions or Abilities. If a rider wants to use a different Rider Action or Ability, they must switch seats.

You gain the following Rider Actions, in addition to Mounted Machine Gun.

## Rider Action: Cannon

This seat controls the massive cannon perched over your head.

Type: Kinetic
Accuracy: `85%`
Damage: `23-25`

## Rider Action: Plasma Hose

This seat controls a hose mounted on a swivel, capable of spewing out a stream of superhot plasma. The plasma leaves behind a `6m` long trail, drawing any continuous shape on the ground. Any entity standing on the plasma trail takes `6-9` Plasma damage.

## Rider Action: Grenade Launcher

This seat controls a built-in grenade launcher.

Type: Missile (Bomb)
Accuracy: `65%`
Damage: `19-23` + Splash

### Splash

An attack with Splash explodes into a fireball on impact. Whether or not the attack hits, the target and all targets within 2 metres take 6 Missile damage.

## Action: Throw

You reach your arm around, grabbing a rider or another entity within `2m` and catapulting them up to `28m` across the battlefield.

An unwilling participant can use their Evasion to attempt to avoid this effect, but if they fail they take 6 damage when they land. A willing participant lands gracefully.
