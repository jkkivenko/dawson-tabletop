#WIP #engineer 

# Prerequisites

[[Holo-squad]]

# Description

Through an endearing amount of effort, you've engineered a permanent Holo-clone which has a simple personality and consciousness.

# Effect

You gain the Create Holo-friend Action

## Action: Create Holo-friend

**Requirement: You have 3 or less Holo-clones active, and you do not already have a Holo-friend active.**

You materialise your Holo-friend. It looks like you and acts similar to you, but it has its own distinct personality and memories which persist even if it is destroyed or deactivated. The Holo-friend is a living Synthetic being for the purpose of resolving effects, though this may or may not be obvious based on its actions; when it is first created, it is young and confused - give it time to grow!

It still obeys your Holo-visor commands unquestioningly, but it may not obey your verbal commands - in fact, it may even argue with them or get mad at you. If you do not give it commands, it acts of its own accord, making meaningful decisions based on the information it has if necessary.

Your Holo-friend counts as two Holo-clones for the purposes of Holo-squad, meaning you can have a maximum of 3 other Holo-clones active while your Holo-friend is active.

Unlike a normal Holo-clone, your Holo-friend does not dematerialise if you don't give it commands for 30 seconds. However, it is still destroyed if it takes damage.

Unlike a normal Holo-clone, your Holo-friend has a physical form - it can interact with objects, fire weapons, speak, and do interact with the physical world like anyone else. 

The Holo-friend gains the same benefits as a regular Holo-clone for the purpose of Holo-soldier, except that it has `60` Shield Integrity instead of `20`.
