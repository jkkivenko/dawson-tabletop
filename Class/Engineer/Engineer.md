# Description

As an Engineer, you provide an essential function aboard a starship: when something goes wrong, you can be trusted to come up with a quick solution to save the ship from certain disaster. Whether that means diverting power, modulating the shield frequency, or fixing a broken FTL Drive, you are intimately familiar with the inner workings of a starship. However, youâ€™re just as valuable when the fight becomes personal - you can use advanced tech to disable enemies and support allies on the battlefield.
