# Description

With telescopic mechanisms, you've augmented your arms with extendable graspers, allowing you to reach further.

# Effects

You can reach 6 metres. Any Gear you're holding in your hands can activate their effects from any point within `6m` of you.

If you use this ability to perform an action that requires sight (like aiming a weapon or entering a code), you must be able to see the target of your action or the target gets a `+30%` Evasion chance against your action.
