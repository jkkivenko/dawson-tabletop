# Prerequisites

[[Engineer]]

# Description

You never leave your quarters without a belt of deployable machinery. When it comes down to combat, you can throw down puck of metal and servos which unfolds into an advanced turret, capable of tracking targets of your choosing.

# Effects

You gain the following Engineer Creation.

## Engineer Creation: Deployable Turret

You can spend one action to toss a machinery puck up to 4 metres, after which it unfolds into a Deployable Turret with the stats detailed below. You can only have one Deployable Turret at a time, and you must spend 4 hours engineering a new one if yours is lost or destroyed.

As part of the action spent to deploy the turret, you can also issue it a command via your Holo-visor to lock onto a target. The turret will only attack that target until it is no longer able to (i.e. the target dies, moves out of range, hides, or becomes invisible), after which point you can spend another action to issue the command to lock onto a new target.

### Deployable Turret

Integrity: `40`
Speed: `0 m/s`

#### Turret Action: Attack

Type: Kinetic
Range: `18 metres`
Accuracy: `80%`

## Action: Turret Expertise

**Requirement: You are operating an Engineering Workstation.**

Because of your understanding of weapons engineering, you can boost a Spacecraft's weapons beyond their normal function.

Pick one Powered Weapon System. Until the start of your Spacecraft's next turn, that Weapon System functions as though its Power Draw were increased by `1`.
