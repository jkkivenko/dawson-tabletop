# Description

With a quick command, you rush two of your Drones to your location, using their power to project a shield bubble around you.

# Effects

You gain the Converge action.

## Action: Converge

Two Drones of your choice rush to your aid. You gain a Shield Integrity of `200` and an Evasion Chance of `+10%`, but those two Drones can no longer use any actions.

You can dismiss Converge at any time, at which point your Drones return to normal.
