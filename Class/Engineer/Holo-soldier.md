# Prerequisites

Holo-clone

# Description

You've managed to equip your Holo-clones with weaponry like your own, though they still require your co-ordination. 

# Effects

Your Holo-clones gain the ability to attack, though they still cannot touch objects. 

Your Holo-clones gain the Integrated Laser action granted by your Integrated Exo-suit. If you have Holo-blade, Light Disc, Skeet Shot, or Light Grenade, your Holo-clones gain those actions too.

Additionally, your Holo-clones now have `20` Shield Integrity. Instead of disappearing at the slightest damage, they disappear upon reaching `0` Shield Integrity.
