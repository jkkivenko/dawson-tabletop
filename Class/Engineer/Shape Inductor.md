#WIP #engineer 

# Prerequisites

[[Deployable Labyrinth]]

# Description

You have augmented your Deployable Walls with a shape inductor: a small device which changes your walls from simple squares to any shape imaginable.

# Effects

When you deploy a wall, you can choose customise its shape with your Holo-visor. If you choose to, pick any shape which fits within a `4m x 4m x 10m` cube centered on the machinery puck you threw. The shape can be solid hollow, can have any number of sides, and does not need to be continuously connected.

If you have One-way Walls, you must decide for every face of the shape whether it allows passage and from which direction.
