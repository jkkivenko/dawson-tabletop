# Prerequisites

[[Engineer]]

# Description

Through engineering, tinkering, and surgeries which would make a doctor wince, you have integrated mechanical components into your body. Your Mechanical Exo-suit can take a multitude of forms, but it always comes equipped with a multitude of useful tools and abilities allowing you to be a versatile craftsperson regardless of the situation.

# Effects

You gain the following Engineer Creation.

## Engineer Creation: Integrated Exo-suit

You are always wearing your Integrated Exo-suit, which may take the form of an exoskeleton, mechanical armour, holographic toolbelts and headgear, or something else altogether. In any case, they're integrated into your body - you can't be separated from your Mechanical Exo-suit without surgery. 

Your suit grants you the actions and abilities detailed below.

### Passive: Integrated Tools

You are never without your tools. Whether you have a multitool cybernetic hand, a holographic toolbelt, or a complex arm attachment, you are always treated as having a [[Toolbox]] and [[Repair Kit]].

### Passive: Exo-suit Functionality

Your Integrated Exo-suit functions like a regular [[Exo-suit]], allowing you to breathe in environments which normally would not permit it and survive in the vacuum of space.

### Action: Integrated Laser

More than just a walking toolbox, you're capable of dishing out damage just as well with a hidden laser.

Type: Laser
Accuracy: `100%`
Damage: `7-8`

## Action: Computer Integration

**Requirement: You are operating a Workstation.**

Being partially machine yourself, you can directly interface with a computer using a neural-electric link on your arm or hand. 

You immediately gain 2 actions, which can only be used to take actions requiring a Workstation.
