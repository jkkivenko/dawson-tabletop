# Description

By combining two Deployable Turrets and two Deployable Walls, you create a nearly-indestructible holo-bunker wherever you need on the battlefield, complete with two highly defensible crewed guns capable of raining down hell on your enemies.

# Effects

You gain the Deployable Bunker Engineer Creation.

## Engineer Creation: Deployable Bunker

You can spend three actions tossing 4 machinery pucks down within 4 metres of you. They instantly unfold, projecting an imposing holographic bunker around you which takes up a `10m x 10m x 4m` cube. It is made of sturdy translucent holograms with two crewed turrets which no longer attack automatically but deal significantly more damage.

If you have Laser Turrets, Plasma Turrets, Missile Turrets, or Repulsor Turrets then you can choose to replace one or both of the turrets with their corresponding options detailed below.

If you have One-way Walls, the walls of the Deployable Bunker can be exited but not entered.

If you have Regenerative Walls, the Deployable Bunker regains `90` Integrity per turn.

If you have Mobile Turret, you can command the Deployable Bunker to move using one action. It gains a Speed of `6m/s`.
