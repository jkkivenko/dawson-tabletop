# Prerequisites

[[Light Disc]]

# Description

You have modified your Light Discs to contain stockpiles of resonating energy. When you fling one into the air and shoot it, it explodes into a shower of dazzling lights.

# Effects

You gain the Skeet Shot action.

## Action: Skeet Shot

You fling a Light Disc into the air and shoot it with your laser at the apex of its arc, causing it to explode into a distracting light show.

Pick a location within `12m` to explode your light disc at. Every entity which relies on visible sight within `6m` of this location is temporarily dazzled, granting a `+15%` Evasion chance to the targets of their attacks.
