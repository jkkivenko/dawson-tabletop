# Prerequisites

[[Deployable Turret]]

# Description

In addition to your turrets, you also carry around two metal pucks capable of projecting translucent holographic walls. Despite being holograms, these walls are more than capable of blocking enemy fire, providing cover, and preventing movement.

# Effects

You gain the following Engineer Creation.

## Engineer Creation: Deployable Wall

You can spend one action to toss a machinery puck up to 4 metres, after which it unfolds into a Deployable Wall with the stats detailed below. You can only have two Deployable Walls at a time, and you must spend 4 hours engineering a new one for each wall of yours which is lost or completely destroyed. However, a wall which has its integrity reduced to `0` simply needs to have its holo-capacitors recharged on a Spacecraft or similar source of power.

As part of the action spent to deploy a wall, you choose its orientation using your Holo-visor. It is always centered on its puck, but it can be facing any direction thanks to its holographic nature. You can spend another action to reorient the wall afterwards, though this is subject to the same limitations.

Deployable Walls provide complete cover from enemy fire which would need to pass through them, but they are slightly translucent. Deployable Walls are treated as Shields for effects which have special conditions.

### Deployable Wall

Integrity: `80`
Size: `0.1m x 2m x 1m`

## Action: Shield Expertise

**Requirement: You are operating an Engineering Workstation.**

Because of your understanding of shields and defences, you can boost a Spacecraft's shields beyond their normal function.

Pick one Powered Shield System. Until the start of your Spacecraft's next turn, that Shield System functions as though its Power Draw were increased by `1`.
