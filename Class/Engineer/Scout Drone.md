# Description

You've figured out how to gain better scouting capabilities from your Drones, allowing them to fly further and seek more precisely.

# Effects

When you pick this ability, choose any number of your Drones to convert into Scout Mode. Afterwards, you must spend 4 hours tinkering to convert a Drone between different Modes or back to its regular Mode.

In addition to their regular capabilities, Scout Mode Drones have their Range increased to `60m`. Additionally, when they take the Scout action they can see using any or all of the vision augmentations granted by your Holo-visor (for example, Far-wavelength Sensors).
