# Prerequisites

[[Split Control]]

# Description

You've figured out how to fit more firepower into your Drones, allowing them to drop bombs on your targets.

# Effects

When you pick this ability, choose any number of your Drones to convert into Bomber Mode. Afterwards, you must spend 4 hours tinkering to convert a Drone between different Modes or back to its regular Mode.

In addition to their regular capabilities, Bomber Mode Drones can use the Bombs Away action.

#### Action: Bombs Away

Using your Holo-visor, you instruct your Drone to drop large bombs on a target within Range of you, with the effects detailed below. You must be able to see the target, but you do not need to have a clear shot on the target - however, it must be targetable from above.

Type: Missile (Bomb)
Accuracy: `85%`
Damage: `18-19`
