# Prerequisites

[[Engineer]]

# Description

You have equipped your Holo-visor with sensors capable of detecting all wavelengths of light, from radio and infrared to x-rays and gamma rays.

# Effects

By spending one action, you can switch your Holo-visor to see Radio, Infrared, or High-energy light waves. These effects only work when you're observing the source of the radiation - a holoprojection or viewscreen won't do the trick.

## Action: See Radio

You gain the ability to see Radio waves, allowing you to see where others are communicating from even through walls. Everything becomes dark to you, except for glowing hotspots where personal communicators, communication antennae, or transmitters are active. The more powerful the Radio source, the brighter they glow. 

Everything else becomes dark, granting non-Radio sources a `+15%` Evasion chance against you.

These effects can be dismissed by spending another action to return to regular colour vision.

## Action: See Infrared

You gain the ability to see Infrared light, allowing you to see hot-blooded creatures, machines, and other sources of heat even through walls. Everything becomes blurry to you, except for mammals, machines, flames, and hot objects which glow with a brightness corresponding to their heat.

Everything else becomes blurry, granting non-Infrared sources a `+10%` Evasion chance against you.

These effects can be dismissed by spending another action to return to regular colour vision.

## Action: See High-energy Wavelengths

You gain the ability to see High-energy light (ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays), allowing you to see sources of exotic radiation even through walls. Everything becomes confusingly high-contrast to you, but you can see clear glowing hotspots where radiation, electromagnetic machinery, and exotic materials are stored. The more powerful the source, the brighter they glow.

Everything else becomes dazzlingly bright and high-contrast, granting non-sources a `+20%` Evasion chance against you.

These effects can be dismissed by spending another action to return to regular colour vision.
