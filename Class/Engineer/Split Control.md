#WIP #engineer 

# Prerequisites

[[Drone]]

# Description

Through tinkering and practice, you've figured out how to control two Drones at once.

# Effects

You now control a second Drone, which has its own actions independent of your first. It has all the same actions and abilities as your first Drone, and once per turn you can spend one action to grant it two actions as usual. This does not prevent you from granting actions to your first Drone as well.

# Follow-on Abilities

[[Drone Command Interface]]
[[Bomber Drone]]
[[Scout Drone]]
[[Converge]]
