# Prerequisites

Engineer

# Description

You are always accompanied by your latest construction: a rocket-powered Drone which flies high above you. With precise commands, you can have it scout, strike, or protect you.

# Effects

You gain the Drone Engineer Creation.

## Engineer Creation: Drone

A Drone follows you overhead, equipped with a small laser weapon and sensors. Once per turn, you can spend one action to grant this Drone two actions which it takes in any order on your turn. The Drone is visible to those on the ground, though they might not be able to tell what it is and do not know that you are controlling it.

Range: `30m`

### Action: Attack

Using your Holo-visor, you instruct your Drone to fire at one target within Range of you, with the effects detailed below. You must be able to see the target, but you do not need to have a clear shot on the target - however, it must be targetable from above.

Type: Laser
Accuracy: `100%`
Damage: `8-9`

### Action: Scout

Using your Holo-visor, you instruct your Drone to fly over a specific region within Range of you and search for threats or POIs. Until you target another region with this Drone, you see a top-down view on your Holo-visor of the region you specified.

## Passive: Strike Craft

**Requirement: You are operating an Engineering Workstation.**

Your Drones can be remotely controlled from behind an Engineering Workstation, allowing you to operate them in space as remote strike craft.

Your Drones have their range increased by a factor of `100,000`, but you must issue commands from the Engineering Workstation instead of your Holo-visor.
