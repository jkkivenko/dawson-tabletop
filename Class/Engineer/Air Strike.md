# Prerequisites

Bomber Drone

# Description

You've figured out how to fit even more firepower into your Drones, allowing them to drop even bigger bombs on your targets.

# Effects

Your Bomber Mode Drones have their Range increased slightly and have their Bombs Away ability replaced by Air Strike.

Range: `48m`

#### Action: Air Strike

Using your Holo-visor, you instruct your Drone to drop large bombs on a target within Range of you, with the effects detailed below. You must be able to see the target, but you do not need to have a clear shot on the target - however, it must be targetable from above.

Type: Missile (Bomb)
Accuracy: `90%`
Damage: `20-24` + Splash

##### Splash

An attack with Splash explodes into a fireball on impact. Whether or not the attack hits, the target and all targets within 2 metres take 8 Missile damage.
