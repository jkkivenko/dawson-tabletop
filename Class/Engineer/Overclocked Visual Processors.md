#WIP #engineer #spacecraft-action 

# Prerequisites

[[Visual Cortex Integration]]

# Description

With even more tweaks to your Holo-visor, you're able to see Far-wavelength light without the distracting noise.

# Effects

You permanently have the effects of See Radio, See Infrared, and See High-energy Wavelengths, without the Evasion chance they grant to non-source targets. You also gain the Recalibrate action.

## Action: Recalibrate

**Requirement: You are operating an Engineering Workstation.**

You recalibrate the sensors, trying to detect something that they can't normally detect. The Evasion bonus granted to cloaked Spacecraft is decreased by `10%` against your Spacecraft.

Additionally, you can use your Far-wavelength Sensors actions to grant their specified effects to your Spacecraft, allowing your regular sensors to detect non-visible light sources.
