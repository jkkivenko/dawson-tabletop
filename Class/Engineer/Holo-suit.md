# Prerequisites

[[Integrated Exo-suit]]

# Description

You've equipped your Integrated Exo-suit with holographic attachments, allowing it to be quickly hidden or morphed.

# Effects

With one action, you can activate or deactivate your Integrated Exo-suit. It needs to be active to use any of its abilities, but it cannot be seen when deactivated.

Additionally, you gain the Morph ability.

## Passive: Morph

You can change the look of your Holo-suit at will, although it is always obviously holographic in nature.

Also, by spending one action, you can replicate any simple non-weapon Gear. The Gear must remain attached to your suit to function, and it is also obviously holographic in nature.
