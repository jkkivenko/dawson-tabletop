# Description

Your Integrated Exo-suit is more than just a suit - it's a personal space vehicle. 

# Effects

You gain the Transform action.

## Action: Transform

Your armour transforms into a small airtight compartment. If you have Mounted Machine Gun or War Machine, your riders become seated in a small pressurised compartment and can still use their respective abilities.

Whether or not you have Mounted Machine Gun or War Machine, you also gain space for an additional 2 passengers inside your armour.

If your Integrity reaches `0` while you are Transformed, your airtight seal breaks, exposing you and your passengers to the surrounding environment.
