# Prerequisites (AND)

Drone Swarm
Converge

# Description

You've installed systems in your Drones to allow them to work together, granting them improved power but less versatility.

# Effects

When you pick this ability, choose any number of your Drones to convert into Synergy Mode. Afterwards, you must spend 4 hours tinkering to convert a Drone between different Modes or back to its regular Mode.

Synergy Mode Drones can operate as normal Drones, retaining their regular capabilities.

You gain the Synergise action.

## Action: Synergise

You use your Holo-visor to co-ordinate your Synergy Mode Drones. With a command, two ore more of your Synergy Mode Drones join together into a Drone Amalgam detailed below.

You can only ever have one Drone Amalgam at once, and you can free any number of Drones from the Drone Amalgam at any time. When the number of Drones in a Drone Amalgam drops to 1, the Drone Amalgam ceases to exist and any remaining Drones are freed.

### Drone Amalgam

Your Drones join together, losing their regular capabilities and the ability to act independently but becoming much more powerful. 

The constituent Drones temporarily cease to exist, having been joined into one larger entity. Instead of flying far overhead, the Drone Amalgam flies 2 metres off the ground and is similar in size to a human.

| Number of Drones | Integrity | Speed | Weapons | Abilities |
|------------------|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|
| 2 | Integrity `100` | `2m/s` | Laser Machine Gun |
| 3 | Integrity `150`, Shield `50` | `4m/s` | Laser Rifle, Rocket Pod |
| 4 | Integrity `250`, Shield `75` | `12m/s` | Repulsor Rifle, Rocket Pod | Carry Away |

#### Laser Machine Gun

Type: Laser
Accuracy: `100%`
Damage: `10-11`

#### Laser Rifle

Type: Laser
Accuracy: `100%`
Damage: `15-16`

#### Repulsor Rifle

Type: Repulsor
Accuracy: `95%`
Damage: `23-26` + Knockback (`2`)

##### Knockback

A shot with Knockback imparts kinetic energy when it impacts an enemy. If it successfully hits a target, the target is pushed the listed number of metres away.

#### Rocket Pod

Type: Missile (Swarm)
Accuracy: `85%`
Damage: `20-28`

#### Action: Carry Away

Your superpowered Drone Amalgam can lift enemies in the air or knock them off their feet. Choose a target within `12m`. With 50% accuracy, that target is either lifted into the air or knocked to the ground, your choice.

If you choose to lift the target, the Drone Amalgam flies the target `2m` off the ground, moving the target with it whenever it moves. If you have Convergent Lift, you can immediately fly the target up to `10m` when you use this action. If you have Improved Flight Processors, this number increases to `30m`.
