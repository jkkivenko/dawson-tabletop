# Description

You feel more comfortable in the air than on the ground - nobody's blaming you! With enough training, you've mastered the ability to fly like a hummingbird, although it's a little hard to aim without ground beneath your feet.

# Effects

You gain the Hover passive:

## Passive: Hover

You can choose to stay still instead of falling every turn you spend in the air under the effects of gravity. If you do so, 1 unit of fuel from your Blast Pack is consumed at the start of your turn. While you're in the air due to Hover, you suffer a `-10%` Accuracy penalty.
