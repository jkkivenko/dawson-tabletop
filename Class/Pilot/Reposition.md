# Description

In your opinion, a Blast Pack is a precision tool for repositioning on a chaotic battlefield. Rather than jumping into the heat of battle, you prefer to use your Blast Pack to find a tactical perch.

# Effects

You gain the following actions:

## Action: Reposition

If you're experiencing less than `200%` gravity, you immediately fly up to `30m` in any direction. If you're not grounded after this movement, you fall unless you're in zero gravity. This consumes 2 unit of fuel from your Blast Pack.

## Action: Precise Manoeuvre

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation.**

With some fancy steering, you put the Spacecraft in an advantageous position. You move up to the Spacecraft's Speed, ignoring steering limitations.
