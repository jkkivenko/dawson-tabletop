# Description

When you barrel into an enemy, you just don't stop moving. Instead, you and your target continue to fly in the direction you were going. It can even come in handy if your ally is in harm's way!

# Effects

If you hit with Rocket Tackle, you and the target move up to `4m` in the direction you were moving. Additionally, you can choose to deal no damage with Rocket Tackle.
