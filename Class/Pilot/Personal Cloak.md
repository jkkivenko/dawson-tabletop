Using that internal volume, you've chosen to become an unseen scout or assassin by installing a small cloaking device which disrupts your silhouette and makes you hard to notice.

You gain the Personal Cloak action:

## Action: Personal Cloak

Your Personal Cloak activates, granting you a `+20%` Evasion change while active. When you use this action and at the start of all subsequent turns while Personal Cloak is active, 1 unit of fuel from your Blast Pack is consumed. You can deactivate this effect for free with a press of a button.
