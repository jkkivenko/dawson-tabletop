#WIP #pilot 

# Description

Look, we know there's a huge rocket engine strapped to it but that doesn't mean it's not also a backpack! This may not be the most glamourous choice for a daring Pilot, but all that extra space allows for extra fuel to be carried which could come in handy. Hell, it might even allow you to fit some cool gear in there later on!

# Effects

Your Blast Pack can carry up to `4` units of fuel.

# Follow-on Abilities

[[Extra Fuel Tanks]]
