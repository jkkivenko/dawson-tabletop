# Description

Do we really have to explain this one? You have a chemical thruster strapped to your back. Why wouldn't you turn yourself into a rocket-powered projectile aimed straight at your enemies' faces?

# Effects

You gain the following actions:

## Action: Rocket Tackle

If you're experiencing less than `200%` gravity, you immediately fly adjacent to a target within `8m`, dealing `10-14` Kinetic damage to the target with `90%` Accuracy. This consumes `1` unit of fuel from your Blast Pack, whether or not it hits.

## Action: Ramming Speed

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation.**

You bring the Spacecraft up to ramming speed. Choose a target within your Speed range idk, then hit it and idk
