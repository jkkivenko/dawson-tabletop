# Description

Once you're in position, you divert fuel from your Blast Pack to power a hovering gyroscopic tripod for extreme precision.

# Effects

You gain the following actions:

## Action: Gyroscopic Tripod

**Requirement: You are grounded.**

Your Gyroscopic Tripod activates, granting you `+10%` Accuracy and `+10%` Range for weapon attacks while active. When you use this action and at the start of all subsequent turns while Gyroscopic Tripod is active, 1 unit of fuel from your Blast Pack is consumed. You can deactivate this effect for free with a press of a button.

## Action: Steady as She Goes

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation and have not Moved this turn.**

You expertly line up your Spacecraft's weapons. For the next `10s`, your Spacecraft cannot Move but your Spacecraft's Weapons gain a `+20%` Accuracy bonus.
