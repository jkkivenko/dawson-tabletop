# Description

As a Pilot, it often falls to you to fly Spacecraft, navigate hazards, plot FTL courses, and know your way around the galaxy. A Spacecraft without a pilot is like an EVA without an Exo-suit - dead in space! Even on ground missions, you're never far from the controls with a Blast Pack strapped to your back and a daring streak in your heart, and you feel right at home flying around the battlefield and delivering attacks from unexpected places.

Whether behind the helm of a Spacecraft or flying with your Blast Pack, provide your crew with positional support and reconnaissance while keeping out of harm's way.

# Effects

When you take the Pilot Class, you immediately gain the [[Piloting Prowess]] and [[Space Savant]] [[Skills|Skill Abilities]]. Additionally, you gain your Blast Pack, an oversized rocket-powered backpack which you can use to reposition yourself tactically on the battlefield, and the Blast Off action.

### Rocket Fuel

Your Blast Pack can only store 3 units of fuel, but don't worry - it contains a tiny electrolysis device which can create more fuel out of eco-friendly humid air! Isn't the future amazing? All it takes is 8 hours of idling inside an atmosphere and it's good as new, though it can always be topped off with fuel from another source in a pinch.

## Action: Blast Off

If you're experiencing less than `200%` gravity, you immediately fly up to `16m` in any direction. If you're not grounded after this movement, you fall unless you're in zero gravity. This consumes 1 unit of fuel from your Blast Pack.
