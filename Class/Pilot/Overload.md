# Description

When all hope is lost, you can always go out in a blaze of glory (and fire, of course). Though it's not your first choice, you can cause a huge explosion which is dangerous to yourself as well as others nearby.

# Effects

You gain the following actions:

## Action: Overload

Choose an amount of fuel less than or equal to the amount remaining in your Blast Pack. With an Accuracy of `95%`, you immediately deal `10-13` Damage multiplied by the number of fuel units consumed to all lifeforms and objects within `4m` of you (including yourself). This consumes the amount of fuel chosen from your Blast Pack.

## Action: Disable Safeties

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation.**

You disable safeties and throttle up. The Spacecraft's Speed increases by `24m/s` for the next `40s`. After the duration ends, the Spacecraft's Speed decreases by `10m/s` for the next `10s`.
