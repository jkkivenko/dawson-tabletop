# Description

# Effects

You gain the Precision following actions:

## Action: Precision Targeting System

Your Precision Targeting System activates, granting you `+10%` Accuracy and `+10%` Range for weapon attacks while active.

You can deactivate this effect for free with a press of a button.

You expertly line up your Spacecraft's weapons. For the next `10s`, your Spacecraft's Weapons gain a `+10%` Accuracy bonus.
