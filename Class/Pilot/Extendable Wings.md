# Description

It happens to the best of us - you're soaring through the air, performing stomach-turning tricks and dodging laser fire, when suddenly your fuel indicator beeps empty. That's why you've used your extra space to install some extendable fins to your pack, allowing you to glide. 

# Effects

You do not take damage from falling. Additionally, you gain the Glide action.

## Glide

**Requirement: You are at least `2m` in the air and within an atmosphere.**

You use your wings to glide. You move `10m` in any direction perpendicular to the pull of gravity.
