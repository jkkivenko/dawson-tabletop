# Description

Fuel is a limited resource and you've realised that rockets are just too inefficient. You've modified your Blast Pack to use Ion engines in addition to its regular Chemical ones, reducing the fuel cost for regular actions but only when you're in outer space.

# Effects

Blast Off, Rocket Tackle and Hover no longer consume any fuel while outside of an atmosphere.

# Follow-on Abilities

[[Repulsor Conversion]]
[[Stealth Blast]]
