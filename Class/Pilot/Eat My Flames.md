# Description

Great, now you're right next to a dangerous enemy - well, discretion is the better part of valour. You might as well singe the enemy as you blast directly backwards, smirking into their dumb face the whole time.

# Effects

You gain the following actions:

## Action: Eat My Flames

If you're experiencing less than `200%` gravity, you immediately deal `6-7` Plasma damage with an Accuracy of `95%` to 1 target of your choice within `2m` of you, then fly `16m`. This consumes `1` unit of fuel from your Blast Pack.

## Action: Afterburner

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation**

You rev the engines, blasting hot exhaust at a Spacecraft on your tail. Choose a target within `50m` of the back of your Spacecraft. Then apply an effect based on your engine type:

| Engine Type | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Chemical | Deal `12-17` Plasma damage to the target, and move it backward `22m`. |
| Ion | Deal `19-25` Plasma damage to the target's Shields. |
| Repulsor | Deal `24-26` Repulsor damage to the target. |
