# Introduction

Once you have a game world and Characters to play in it, it's time to play the game. Sit down around a table with your Dawsoneers and set the scene. Tell an adventurous story, fight in epic space battles, and explore the Dawson galaxy!

During a typical session, play typically alternates between two Scales: Ship and Ground. Ship-scale encounters usually have the entire party on the bridge of their Starship, controlling ship systems from behind the safety of their shields and armour. In this Scale, players are usually operating a Workstation and are able to use Ship Actions in addition to their regular Actions. They might be exploring a planetary system, communicating with alien vessels, or engaging in ship-to-ship combat in outer space. In Ground-scale combat, players only have whatever they can carry on their backs. They operate hand tools, move independently, and do battle using their personal weapons and abilities. In this Scale, Dawsoneers might investigate a temple on the surface of a planet, talk to an ambassador aboard his ship, or fight a boarding party in hand-to-hand combat.

## Adjudicating Rules

If multiple rules seem to disagree or contradict, a general rule of thumb is: the more specific rule overrides the general one. If an Action specifies that it can only be taken once per turn, but a specific Ability specifies that it allows that Action to be taken more than once on a turn, then the Ability takes precedence.

If it is still not clear which rule takes precedence, or if this rule of thumb leads to counterintuitive interactions, the GM has the final say on what happens. Dawsoneers who disagree with their GMs get thrown out of the airlock, so please respect your GM's decisions!

# Gameplay Flow

In Dawson, non-combat gameplay is roleplay-centric. You may have noticed that your Characters have very few social abilities or actions; as a Dawsoneer, it's your job to stay in character while roleplaying without relying on social abilities to guide you. If your Character is a witty Pilot who tends to run his mouth, don't also be a genius tactician and a wise sage. If you stick within your Character's role, it's more fun for everyone!

This ties into a core [[Core Tenets|Tenet of Dawson]]: [[Raising the Stakes]]. Through the Characters' decisions (and often, through their failures), the stakes of the encounter increase to keep things interesting. For this reason, it's essential to play your Character accurately: their flaws might cause problems, but that's why you have a whole array of abilities to solve them!

When roleplay fails and it's time to pull out the guns, the burden of fairness no longer falls on the players. During [[Combat]], GMs and Dawsoneers follow strict rules to determine the outcomes. Whether blasting laser holes through an enemy Spacecraft or standing face-to-face with an alien monster, combat is when you can really show off your Character's Abilities.

Usually, each party acts on its turn. In Ground Combat, this means that each individual has its own turn on which it uses its 3 actions. In Ship Combat, Ships have turns but individuals do not - any member of a Ship's crew acts on its Ship's turn in any order, instead of taking its own turn. Notably, each party can only use each action once per turn. This means you can't move twice or attack nonstop on your turn.

# Technobabble

A core [[Tenet of Dawson]] is [[Camp]], which would be totally impossible without [[Technobabble]].

Technobabble is simple: it's when a Character says an incomprehensible string of scientific-sounding words, sometimes throwing in a simple metaphor or explanation, ending by describing its effects in simple language. Technobabble can be invoked in the middle of combat, while exploring a planetary surface, in the middle of exploring an interstellar anomaly, or at any other point during gameplay.

Importantly, Technobabble allows seemingly impossible things to become possible while also [[Raises the Stakes]]. It's up to the GM to adjudicate the effects of Technobabble, sometimes deciding on a percentage chance that it works.
