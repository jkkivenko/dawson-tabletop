Adaptable societies value personal freedom and individuality above all else. They might be nomadic, exploring anything and everything the galaxy has to show, or a diplomatic society which encourages personal fulfilment and growth. Members of these societies might strive to make a name for themselves, fight against abusive systems, or simply follow wherever their whims take them.
