Reclusive societies keep to themselves, locking the galaxy at large away behind a curtain of xenophobia and isolationism. Whether they keep tightly patrolled borders, have deals with other cultures to stay away, or are simply hidden, Reclusive societies push others away out of fear, superiority or just plain apathy. Members of these societies might be curious about the galaxy outside their walls, or they might strive to keep themselves isolated from it with tight lips and a healthy distrust towards others.
