# Description

A Character's Skills represents their nuanced knowledge, personality traits, and passions that go beyond a simple Class or job. Skills are available to everyone regardless of Class, Physiology, or Society, although those features can grant Skills as well. Skills don't help out too much in combat, but they do give your Character new ways to interact with the world and provide a handy way to add flavour and backstory to a Character.

The more you invest in a skill, the more it pays off. Look down these branches and see if anything jumps out at you!

## Enrich Skills

Some Skills are tagged with #enrich. Unlike most abilities, these don't provide any strict Effects. Instead, they add flavour and detail to a Character and usually rely on the GM to provide roleplay effects. However, they are often prerequisites for mechanically impactful skills, so you'll want to take them even if you don't give a fermion about flavour.

# Effects

With enough effort and luck, you can do anything. You gain the Effort action and the Get to Work activity.

## Action: Effort

You try to recall something, figure something out, move something, make something, or convince someone of something. The GM determines your likelihood of success based on how easy the Effort is and how Familiar you are with the subject. On a success, you successfully do whatever it is you were trying to do. On a failure, you don't. There might be further penalties for failure subject to the GM, such as hurting yourself or wasting materials.

See the Effort Table below for suggested success chances, although GMs are encouraged to come up with their own Accuracies on the fly. Keep in mind that anything easier than Easy should be considered trivial, not requiring an Effort; likewise anything harder than Challenging is too complicated to be done in a single action, requiring more time and investment.

### Reference: Effort Table

| Difficulty | Example | Accuracy |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Easy | Lifting a heavy item, doing laborious mental arithmetic, fashioning a simple tool. | `80%` |
| Moderate | Scaling a rocky wall, pleading with a guard, reconfiguring a device. | `50%` |
| Challenging | Smashing through a sealed door, lying to a polygraph, crafting an improvised explosive. | `25%` |

Regardless of the difficulty, your odds can be increased or decreased by your Familiarity with the subject. It may be difficult to smash through a sealed door, unless you happen to be a security officer intimately familiar with the door's weaknesses.  See Familiarity below for adding bonuses and penalties based on a Character's Familiarity.

## Activity: Get to Work

You try to do something that takes longer than 10 seconds, up to several hours or days, such as assembling a device, plotting a complicated course, or gathering information from a city. The GM determines your likelihood of success based on how easy the task is and how Familiar you are with the subject. On a success, you successfully do whatever it is you were trying to do. On a failure, you don't. There might be further penalties for failure subject to the GM, such as hurting yourself or wasting materials.

See the Get to Work Table below for suggested success chances, although GMs are encouraged to come up with their own Accuracies on the fly. Keep in mind that anything easier than Easy should be considered trivial, succeeding as long as you put the required time into it; likewise anything harder than Impossible is too complicated for you to accomplish without extra help.

### Reference: Get to Work Table

| Difficulty | Example | Accuracy |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Easy | Gathering materials, navigating a crowded space station, researching information | `80%` |
| Moderate |  | `65%` |
| Tough |  | `45%` |
| Challenging |  | `25%` |
| Impossible | Digging through rock without tools, | `10%` |

## Familiarity

Skills can only take you so far - if you're trying to interact with something you've never even heard of, you're probably out of luck. For that reason, your Familiarity with a subject usually provides the listed benefits or penalties below. 

### Reference: Familiarity Table

| Familiarity | Example | Effect |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Like the Back of Your Hand | A weapon you built, the Spacecraft you live on, your own culture. | `+50%` Accuracy |
| Second Nature | An object you've studied, a personal fascination, a device you use daily. | `+35%` Accuracy |
| Familiar | A lifeform you've met, a place you frequent, a technology you've worked with. | `+20%` Accuracy |
| Recognisable | A common scientific instrument, a well-known public figure, a historical event. | `+10%` Accuracy |
| Ordinary | A straightforward system, standard-issue gear, a weapon you've seen discharge. | None |
| Unfamiliar | A reclusive society, nonstandard Spacecraft upgrades, a rare material. | `+10%` Evasion |
| Unknown | A Spacecraft you've never seen before, an uncharted energy phenomenon, a language you've never heard. | `+20%` Evasion |
| Esoteric | A satellite made of alien tech, an uncontacted civilisation, an unscannable device. | `+35%` Evasion |
| Incomprehensible | An unknown legend, extradimensional beings, seemingly impossible phenomena. | `+50%` Evasion |
