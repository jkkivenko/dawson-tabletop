# Description

You know how to manoeuvre a small Spacecraft. You might have learned this skill at a piloting school, on the job, or through watching another pilot. Regardless, you know the basics of moving a small Spacecraft at sublight speeds

# Effects

You gain the following actions:

## Action: Move

**Special: A Ship cannot Move more than once on its turn, even if multiple crewmembers take the Move action.**

You manually control the Ship's engines and thrusters. The Ship immediately moves up to its Speed along any trajectory as long as it does intersect with obstacles.

## Action: Evasive Manoeuvre

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation on an *Orbit-*, *Escape-*, or *Astro*-class Spacecraft.

You input a command, causing the Ship to dodge suddenly to the side. The Ship gains `+10%` Evasion Chance.

## Action: Activate Landing Sequence

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation and the Spacecraft has Landing Struts, a non-zero Speed, and is within `100km` of the landing zone.**

You activate the Spacecraft's landing sequence, extending landing struts, wheels, or skids. You descend towards the landing zone and bring the Ship in for a safe landing.
