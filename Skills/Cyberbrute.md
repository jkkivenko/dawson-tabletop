# Description

Sometimes when you're hacking, subtlety and nuance just don't cut it. You know how to quickly devastate computer systems, but you'd better have a quick getaway method for when things go south.

# Effects

You gain the Brute Force Hack action:

## Action: Brute Force Hack

**Requirement: You have Hacker's Tools or the target computer has a physical interface**

You attempt to hack into a digital device or lifeform within your reach with `75%` Accuracy. Based on your Familiarity with the target computer, your Accuracy may increase or it may gain an Evasion chance against your hack.

On a success, you gain `Level 2` security clearance if you did not already have security clearance. If you did have security clearance, your level of security clearance is increased by two levels, up to the maximum allowed by the target computer.

Regardless of whether you succeed, anyone using the computer is immediately made aware of your attempt, whether or not you succeeded, and your location.
