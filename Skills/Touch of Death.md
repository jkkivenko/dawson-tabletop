# Description

When it comes to computers, you're cursed. Everything you touch seems to glitch or freeze, so you've gotten really familiar with restarting them or shutting them down. You've turned your digital bad luck into a weapon for your advantage: you know shutdown codes for most computer systems that can help in a pinch when you need a computer to stop breathing.

# Effects

You gain the Shutdown Code A1TF4 activity:

## Activity: Shutdown Code A1TF4

You can spend `10` seconds attempting to shut down a digital device or lifeform, either physically or remotely, with `65%` Accuracy even if you don't have security clearance. Based on your Familiarity with the target computer, your Accuracy may increase or it may gain an Evasion chance against your shutdown attempt.

If you attempt to shut it down physically, you must be adjacent to the target computer for the  duration of your shutdown attempt.

If you attempt to shut it down remotely, you must be operating a Communications Workstation and the target computer must stay within your Short Communications Range for the duration of the shutdown attempt. Additionally, the target computer must be able to transmit and receive signals.

On a success, the target computer is temporarily powered down. It is rendered useless until someone spends `1-3` actions rebooting it, after which it enters a lengthy boot sequence lasting `10-100` seconds depending on its complexity and speed.
