# Description

With advanced medical technology, an increasing number of injuries and afflictions can be treated with dermal regenerators, growth stimulators, hypodermic sprays, and chemicals with long names. Not everyone has the know-how to administer lifesaving treatments, but somehow you've picked up the necessary skills.

# Effects

You gain the following:

## Action: Stop the Bleeding

**Requirement: You are carrying a medkit.**

You use a clotting agent, painkiller, burn salve, bandage, or regenerator to temporarily heal an injured non-mechanical lifeform within `2m` (which can be yourself). The lifeform regains `5` Integrity.

## Activity: Treat Wounds

**Requirement: You are carrying a medkit.**

You spend `40` minutes treating an injured non-mechanical lifeform (which can be yourself). The lifeform's Integrity is fully restored as long as its injuries were caused by weapons, blunt force trauma, curable diseases, or other superficial damage.

## Activity: Neutralising Agent

**Requirement: You are carrying a medkit.**

You spend `10` seconds finding the right cure, antivenom, or neutralising agent to counter an affliction affecting a lifeform withing `2m` with `60%` Accuracy. Based on your Familiarity with the affliction, your Accuracy may increase. Likewise, if the affliction is unfamiliar to you, it may gain an Evasion chance against your cure. Certain afflictions have an increased Evasion chance due to their resilient nature, as described in the affliction's effects.
