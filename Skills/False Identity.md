# Description

Having studied cultures for so long, you know what kind of information is required to pass yourself off as a member of a society.

# Effects

You gain the False Identity activity:

## Activity: False Identity

With `4` hours of tailoring clothes, applying makeup, forging documents, and planting evidence, you can pass off up to `2` lifeforms as specific members of another society. You also learn some specifics about the lifeforms they're impersonating, such as their backstories, family, and personal life. 

This is enough to fool an observer, but someone who knows your mark might notice your behavioural differences or recognise your ruse by asking you a question you can't answer.
