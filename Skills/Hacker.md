# Description

One of the most handy tricks in the computer age is the ability to break into systems and bend them to your will. You're trained in doing so, perhaps to steal sensitive data from your enemies or engage in cyberwarfare. Regardless, you know how to get security clearance when you really shouldn't have it.

# Effects

You gain the Hack activity:

## Activity: Hack

You spend `30` seconds attempting to hack into a digital device or lifeform, either physically or remotely, with `55%` Accuracy. Based on your Familiarity with the target computer, your Accuracy may increase or it may gain an Evasion chance against your hack.

If you attempt to Hack physically, you must have [[Hacker's Tools]] or the target computer must have a physical interface. Additionally, you must be adjacent to the target computer for the duration of your Hack.

If you attempt to Hack remotely, you must be operating a Communications Workstation and the target computer must remain within your Short Communications Range for the duration of the Hack. Additionally, the target computer must be able to transmit and receive signals.

On a success, you gain `Level 1` security clearance if you did not already have security clearance. If you did have security clearance, your level of security clearance is increased by one level, up to the maximum allowed by the target computer.
