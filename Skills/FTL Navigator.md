# Description

You understand how to plot FTL courses between the stars - a very different skill from manoeuvring at sublight speeds.

# Effects

You gain the following actions:

## Action: Plot a Course

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation.**

With the help of the Ship's autopilot, you create a Course between any two known locations. These can be well-known locations, locations in the Ship's sensor log, or locations found on a star chart. 

## Action: Engage FTL Drive

**Requirement: You are operating a Helm Workstation, and the Spacecraft is equipped with an FTL Drive.**

You bring the Ship up to FTL speeds, causing the Ship to move at your choice of FTL factor up to and including its FTL Drive's Maximum Factor. As the stars stretch towards the horizon, the Ship can no longer Move. It immediately follow its current plotted Course. Taking this action again returns the ship's FTL Drive to standby mode, allowing the Spacecraft to Move as normal.
