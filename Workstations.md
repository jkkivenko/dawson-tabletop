Dawsoneers standing in front of a Workstation gain access to its associated Actions and Abilities.

# Engineering Workstation

These abilities can be used by any Character operating an Engineering Workstation. This Workstation displays detailed information about ship systems and allows for fine control over power routing. Certain ships or Character Abilities might grant more Engineering Ship Abilities.

## Action: Divert Power

You redistribute power between critical elements of the Ship. Immediately change the Power Draw of any two Systems on the Ship, as long as they end in a state which does not draw more than the Ship's Power.

## Action: Emergency Antimatter Purge

To prevent a Warp Reactor overload, you open the emergency antimatter vents and bring the Warp Reactor to a sudden stop. This drops the Ship's Power to its Backup Power value; if this results in a state where Systems draw more power than can be provided, you choose which Systems have their Power Levels decreased until the Power is sufficient.

## Passive: Reactor Status

You can see the status and integrity of the Warp Reactor, if one is present. You can also see the Ship's current Power and the Power Draw of each installed System.

# Piloting Workstation

These abilities can be used by any Character operating a Piloting Workstation. This Workstation displays information about the Ship's heading and velocity and allows for manual flying as well as autopilot control.

## Action: Move

**Special: A Ship cannot Move more than once on its turn, even if multiple crewmembers take the Move action.**

You manually control the Ship's engines and thrusters. The Ship immediately moves up to its Speed in any direction.

## Action: Evasive Manoeuvre

You input a command, causing the Ship to undertake a preprogrammed manoeuvre. The Ship gains `+10%` Evasion Chance.

## Action: Plot a Course

You create a Course between any two known locations. 

## Action: Warp

**Requirement: The Ship is equipped with a Warp Reactor.**

You bring the Ship up to Warp, causing the Ship to move at your choice of speed up to and including its Warp Reactor's Maximum Warp. As the stars stretch towards the horizon, the Ship can no longer Move. It immediately follow its current plotted Course. Taking this action again causes the ship to drop out of Warp, returning controls to normal.

## Action: Activate Landing Sequence

**Requirement: The Spacecraft has Landing Struts and you are within `100km` of the landing zone. If the landing zone is inside an atmosphere, the Spacecraft must be capable of atmospheric flight.**

You activate the Spacecraft's landing sequence, extending landing struts, wheels, or skids. You descend towards the landing zone and bring the Ship in for a safe landing. 

## Passive: Trajectory Status

You can see the Ship's heading, track, speed (including Warp Speed), and current course.

# Tactical Workstation

These abilities can be used by any Character operating a Tactical Workstation. This Workstation displays information about the Ship's weapon status and allows for advanced weapon targeting. Such a Workstation is absent from vessels which do not have weapons.

For specifics on firing each ship weapon, see [[Systems#Weapons Systems|Weapons Systems]].

## Passive: Tactical Status

You can see the Status and Integrity of the Ship's Weapons, Shields, and Hull.

# Communications Workstation

These abilities can be used by any Character operating a Communications Workstation. This Workstation displays information from the Ship's scanner arrays and allows for long-range communication.

## Action: Scanner Sweep

You activate the Ship's scanners, searching for long-range targets or points of interest. Your Communications Range increases to the Ship's Active Communications Range for the next minute or something.

## Action: Hail

You send out a hail. This can target a specific ship, or it can be broadcast to all targets within your Communications Range. You can choose to send an audio message up to 10 minutes in length or a holo-message up to 1 minute in length.

## Action: Transmit

You send out a transmission. Choose a target within your Communications Range. Send an audio message up to 1 hour in length, a holo-message up to 10 minutes in length, or data up to 1TB in size or something.

## Passive: Sensor Status

You see the Status and Integrity of all scanners and scientific instruments equipped on the Ship. You can also see basic information about all vessels, stars, planets, or other points of interest within your Communications Range, as well as specific information granted by any scientific instruments installed on the Ship.
