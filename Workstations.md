Dawsoneers standing in front of a Workstation gain access to its associated Actions and Abilities.

# Engineering Workstation

These abilities can be used by any Character operating an Engineering Workstation. This Workstation displays detailed information about ship systems and allows for fine control over power routing. Certain ships or Character Abilities might grant more Engineering Ship Abilities.

## Action: Divert Power

You redistribute power between critical elements of the Ship. Immediately change the Power Draw of any two Systems on the Ship, as long as they end in a state which does not draw more than the Ship's Power.

## Action: Emergency Antimatter Purge

To prevent an FTL Drive overload, you open the emergency antimatter vents and bring the FTL Drive to a sudden stop. This drops the Ship's Power to its Backup Power value; if this results in a state where Systems draw more power than can be provided, you choose which Systems have their Power Levels decreased until the Power is sufficient.

## Passive: Drive Status

You can see the status and integrity of the FTL Drive, if one is present. You can also see the Ship's current Power and the Power Draw of each installed System.

# Helm Workstation

These abilities can be used by any Character operating a Helm Workstation. This Workstation displays information about the Ship's heading and velocity and allows for manual flying as well as autopilot control.

## Action: Move

**Special: A Ship cannot Move more than once on its turn, even if multiple crewmembers take the Move action.**

You manually control the Ship's engines and thrusters. The Ship immediately moves up to its Speed along any trajectory as long as it does intersect with obstacles.

## Action: Evasive Manoeuvre

You input a command, causing the Ship to undertake a preprogrammed manoeuvre. The Ship gains `+10%` Evasion Chance.

## Action: Plot a Course

With the help of the Ship's autopilot, you create a Course between any two known locations. These can be well-known locations, locations in the Ship's sensor log, or locations found on a star chart. 

## Action: Engage FTL Drive

**Requirement: The Ship is equipped with an FTL Drive.**

You bring the Ship up to FTL speeds, causing the Ship to move at your choice of FTL factor up to and including its FTL Drive's Maximum Factor. As the stars stretch towards the horizon, the Ship can no longer Move. It immediately follow its current plotted Course. Taking this action again returns the ship's FTL Drive to standby mode, allowing the Spacecraft to Move as normal.

## Action: Activate Landing Sequence

**Requirement: The Spacecraft has Landing Struts, a non-zero Speed, and is within `100km` of the landing zone.**

You activate the Spacecraft's landing sequence, extending landing struts, wheels, or skids. You descend towards the landing zone and bring the Ship in for a safe landing. 

## Passive: Trajectory Status

You can see the Ship's heading, track, speed (including Warp Speed), and current Course.

# Tactical Workstation

These abilities can be used by any Character operating a Tactical Workstation. This Workstation displays information about the Ship's weapon status and allows for advanced weapon targeting. Such a Workstation is absent from vessels which do not have weapons.

For specifics on firing each ship weapon, see [[Systems (Deprecated)#Weapons Systems|Weapons Systems]].

## Passive: Tactical Status

You can see the Status and Integrity of the Ship's Weapons, Shields, and Hull.

# Communications Workstation

These abilities can be used by any Character operating a Communications Workstation. This Workstation displays information from the Ship's scanner arrays and allows for long-range communication.

## Action: Sensor Sweep

You activate the Ship's scanners, searching for long-range targets or points of interest. For 10 seconds, [[#Passive: Sensor Status|Sensor Status]] uses your Long Communications Range instead of your Short Communications Range.

## Action: Hail

You send out a hail to one or multiple targets within your Short Communications Range or whose Short Communications Range you are within. This can be a short audio, video, or holo- message. This opens a continuous dialogue between you and your target(s) until it is ended. The dialogue also ends if the target leaves your Short Communications Range and you leave your target's Short Communications Range.

## Action: Transmit

You send out a transmission. Choose one or multiple targets within your Long Communications Range. You send an audio message up to 1 hour in length, a holo-message up to 10 minutes in length, or data up to 1TB in size to the target(s).

## Passive: Sensor Status

You see the Status and Integrity of all scanners and scientific instruments equipped on the Ship. If there are any vessels, stars, planets, or other points of interest within your Short Communications Range, you see basic information about them as well as information granted by the Ship's scientific instruments.
