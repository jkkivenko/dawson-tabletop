Dawson has several core tenets which GMs and Dawsoneers must swear by in order to bring the game to life. They ensure that a game of Dawson is fun, fair, and true to its roots. None of them are indisputable, of course, and GMs should use discretion when deciding how a game should play out.

# 1. Camp

Dawson is built to emulate campy 1980s-2000s sci-fi TV and movies. That's why its most important core tenet is camp, or in other words, not taking itself too seriously. Characters should have silly names, solve problems with unrealistic solutions, have plot armour, and generally feel like the main characters on a low-budget film set. GMs should encourage this too, never punishing players for writing campy backstories or overacting.

In order to encourage Camp, Dawson make heavy use of [[Technobabble]] to encourage wacky problem solving, Custom [[Characters]] for overly-complicated lore-heavy backstories, and it even has some premade [[Adventures]] which live out the fantasy.

However, Dawsoneers and GMs shouldn't forget the other two rules. Improper use of Technobabble or plot armour can seriously detract from the gameplay, and go against Raising the Stakes and Give and Take.

# 2. Raising the Stakes

Likewise, Dawson's TV origins require a constantly escalating story (so the audience doesn't get bored, of course). This means that actions (even successful ones) must have consequences which effect the greater story as a whole.

For example, imagine a Character evokes [[Technobabble]] to disable an enemy's Shields using a directed polaron burst from their [[Exotic Matter Spectrometer]]. Whether or not this succeeds, the GM might rule that their polaron burst reflected off the Shields and knocked both ships' navigational sensors out of alignment - and to make things worse, both ships are hurtling towards an uncharted asteroid field!

For another example, imagine the Characters attempt to avoid a plasmionic nebula in their path by charting a course around it. This is a boring action, and a good TV show would never have the audience sit through 18 hours of avoiding interesting things. To remedy this, maybe their new course leads them to discover a lone scientific probe with data from an uncontacted plasmionic species from a nearby star system who believe the nebula is their afterlife. The crew can now investigate the nebula to see if it holds passed-on consciousness, communicate with the non-humanoid plasmionic species, or at least ponder the data that the probe contains.

As you can see, the point of Raising the Stakes is to make uninteresting actions interesting. As Sid Meier and Soren Johnson are quoted for saying, "given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game". The GM's job is to not let this happen: if the players play it safe and try to avoid the nebula or disable the enemy's shields, raise the stakes! Force the Dawsoneers to have fun, even if they fight and kick and scream to do the opposite.

# 3. Give and Take

Finally, as is true in most games, Dawson is most fun if there isn't an objectively best course of action. If a Dawsoneer tries to [[Technobabble]] their way out of a situation, the GM can remind them that the game is a Give and Take by Technobabbling right back. No upgrade should be best, no class should be strongest, and no ship should be useless.

This is done to limit the players, of course, but it also is done to encourage them. If the Dawsoneers make decisions which result in them winning too much, Raise the Stakes until they need to make sacrifices and the game feels dynamic again. If they lose too much, use some Campy plot armour to grant them a daring recovery, allowing them to undo a bad decision with a dramatic resolution.

Give and Take is mostly here to encourage a fair and balanced game. It shouldn't dictate every decision: if the players Raised the Stakes on their own by stealing a Battle Cruiser, let them feel powerful for a couple of fights! Until, of course, you Raise the Stakes right back by having the interstellar police track them down.
