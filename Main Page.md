# Introduction

Dawson is a science-fiction d20 system set all across the galaxy, with an emphasis on exploration and the border between the known and the unknown. Also other stuff!

# Author's Note

Hi, welcome, and beware! I'm the author of this system and I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to read about Dawson. I thought I'd take some time to introduce myself and talk about the inspirations for for the system.

Me personally, I'm a huge fan of the pre- or early-internet era of retro sci-fi from the 80's to 2010's. You'll probably find a lot of language inspired by *Star Trek: The Next Generation* and early *Star Wars*, as well as other media that came out around that time. Dawson heavily features plot devices which try to emulate those stories, like self-destruct sequences, human-like alien races, daring gambits, and mind-bending concepts grounded in personal stories. I love the non-virtual futures presented by this era of sci-fi without an analogue to the internet or iPhone. Despite having advanced ship's computers and artificial intelligence, everything still needs to be done by hand for some inexplicable reason. Critics might wonder why everything hasn't been automated or call this world unrealistic or abstruse, but I think that level of campy hand-waving lends itself really well to charming, not-too-serious stories set in a captivating galaxy.

That's not to say Dawson needs to be played that way. This ruleset can be used to imagine a grim future where everyone needs to fight to survive, a totally alien future where humanity is unheard of, or anything in-between. With a few tweaks, it can even be used to play inside classic sci-fi worlds like *Star Wars*, *Star Trek*, or *Dune*, although that's not exactly how it was intended to be played. 

I created Dawson to live out a world of adventure, freedom, lasers, technobabble, and a hefty dose of camp. I hope you find it as compelling as I do, or at least that you can at a fun playable game out of my mind-ejecta. 

Check out the Characters section for rules about building characters, the Spacecraft section for how to build a custom starship, and the Starting a Game and Playing the Game sections for general rules about how Dawson is played. Then, get a GM and three to five Dawsoneers together and jump into your collective space fantasies.

##### A Note on Wording, Language, and Spelling

I, the author of Dawson, am a Canadian idiot. That means I've split the difference between American and British English, so some of my spellings will be unfamiliar to pretty much everyone. This also means I also use metres for measuring distance. If you're not fluent in the metric system, it's usually sufficient to convert 2 metres to 5 feet for the purposes of Dawson's imprecise measurements.

Additionally, I really like capital letters. I can't blame that one on Canada; I'm just dumb. I sometimes use capitals to indicate that a term is a keyword which you should expect to see repeated a lot, but this usage is inconsistent at best. I try my best to coordinate by application of capital letters, but I make no promises!

Finally, a lot of the words in Dawson are taken almost verbatim from other  media. However, I challenge readers to come up with a word for an FTL engine that isn't Warp, Hyperspace, Lightspeed, or totally stupid. The same goes for shields, universal translators, lasers, and other staples of science fiction. These are not intentional choices made to tie Dawson into an existing IP, but rather inevitabilities stemming from the sheer number of sci-fi properties out there. Any similarity to existing media is purely coincidental.

# [[Characters]]

Every Dawsoneer should have their own character to roleplay, control in combat, and watch grow as they level up and obtain new gear and abilities. Dawson uses a unique skill tree system to allow for versatile characters with awesome abilities befitting a space adventurer. Jump right in and create a character (and maybe a backup!) or carefully plan your brainchild from level 1 to 10.

# [[Spacecraft]]

No space adventure would be complete without a Starship. In a classic space adventure, this will be your home and lifeline in a dangerous, exotic galaxy. In other adventures, they might just be a temporary weapon or a way of getting from one place to another. In any case, spacecraft will undoubtably play an important role in your success and survival, so you should probably familiarise yourself with their capabilities.

##### A Note on Spacecraft-less Adventures

Dawson expects you'll own a Spacecraft, but that's not to say you can't play without them. However, certain abilities and features will be a lot less useful without Spacecraft, so make sure your Dawsoneers know they won't have a Spacecraft before Character creation.

# [[Gear]]

Outside of spaceships, characters in Dawson will find and purchase plenty of smaller pieces of gear and weaponry which they can use in ground-scale adventures. 

# Starting the Game

Before you can play Dawson, you'll need a couple of things: your Dawsoneers (that's what we call players) will each need a [[Characters|Character]], and you'll need to create a story. You can play one of the premade [[Adventures]] or use them as inspiration to create your own.

# [[Playing the Game]]

Once you have a game world and Characters to play in it, it's time to play the game. Sit down around the table with your Dawsoneers and set the scene. Tell an adventurous story, fight in epic space battles, and explore the Dawson galaxy!
