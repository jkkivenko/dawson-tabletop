# Description

A small handheld sensor device which can be used to gather information on a variety of targets. The Scanner is a versatile tool, capable of detecting lifeforms, radiation, technology, and spaces even through solid walls. However, it's not without its limits - handheld Scanners have limited range which can be reduced even further by obstacles, force fields, or jamming signals.

# Effects

You gain the following:

## Passive: Scanner Readout

You can glance at the display on your Scanner to get a general sense of what's going on. You know the number and species of all lifeforms within `20m`, as well as basic details about common types of energy and matter present within the same range.

Scanner Readout cannot detect lifeforms, energy, or matter through `1m` of hard materials (e.g. solid rock, metal), `6m` of soft materials (e.g. soil, wood), or a dampening field, force field, cloak, or similar device.

## Action: Scan

You quickly point your Scanner at a lifeform, object, energy signature, location, or similar target within `20m`. If you Scan a lifeform, you can learn its health status, age, and sex. If you have Scanned this lifeform before, you can also determine its identity.

If you Scan something other than a lifeform, you can learn its chemical makeup, internal structure, or other details up to the GM's discretion.

You cannot Scan through `1m` of hard materials (e.g. solid rock, metal), `6m` of soft materials (e.g. soil, wood), or a dampening field, force field, cloak, or similar device.

## Activity: Study

By spending `10 minutes` studying a target with a Scanner, you can get a greater appreciation with the target. You might learn some key details about it, or the GM might just rule that you become more [[Skills#Familiarity|Familiar]] with the target.

You cannot Study a target through `1m` of hard materials (e.g. solid rock, metal), `6m` of soft materials (e.g. soil, wood), or a dampening field, force field, cloak, or similar device.
