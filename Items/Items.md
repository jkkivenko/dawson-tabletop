# Description

Whether you have one hand or four, almost all advanced lifeforms have the capability to hold and manipulate tools and weapons. Anything that can be held in your hands can count as an Item, although most items have explicit listed uses, like a [[Laser Pistol]] or [[Scanner]]. That's not to say that Items are only useful for their stats - with some creative thinking or reconfiguring, you might be able to coax a lot more out of your gear.

# Effects

When you're holding an Item in the required number of hands, you gain the features it grants. When you release it or hold it in fewer hands than required, you lose those features. If you think that shouldn't need to be mentioned, you're too innocent.

As with most actions, actions granted by Items can only be used once per turn. However, using an item in your left hand **does not** count as the same action as using the same item in your right hand. That means that a Dawsoneer dual-wielding Laser Pistols can use both weapons on the same turn with no penalty, and look cool doing it!
