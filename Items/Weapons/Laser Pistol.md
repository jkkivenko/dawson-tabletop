## Passive: Intensity Setting

With a flick of a switch, you can set your Laster Pistol to stun or kill. When you Fire your Laser Pistol, you can choose to make the damage non-lethal. If you do, and the target is reduced to `0` Integrity from your attack, the target is Stunned for `10 minutes` instead of killed. A Stunned target is unconscious, but can be woken up with a stimulant or by restoring their Integrity.

## Action: Fire

A beam, blast, bolt, or burst of laser energy is discharged from the Pistol's laser emitter. 

Accuracy: `100%`
Damage: `3-4`
