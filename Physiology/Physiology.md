A characterâ€™s Physiology determines their physical traits and abilities. Like Societies, members of any number of alien races can share a given Physiology, but most members of a given race belong to the same Physiology except for under unusual circumstances.

There are 5 Physiologies in Dawson: [[Humanoid]], [[Many-Limbed]], [[Synthetic]], [[Psychic]], and [[Animalistic]].

# Other Physical Traits

A Character's Physiology defines broad traits that they might have: four arms, sharp claws, or bionic eyes. However, Dawsoneers should feel free to add other details to their alien species which, while not having any effect on gameplay, make their Character feel unique.

For example, none of the Physiologies specify:
- skin colour and texture
- hair length and colour (or even whether you have hair)
- face shape
- specific body shape (beyond what is determined by your Physiology)
- presence or absence of ridges and facial features
- vocal qualities
- behaviour

Dawsoneers should think about most or all of these qualities to build a deep, coherent species for their Character.
