# Prerequisites

Predator

# Description

You have specialised claws for climbing, allowing you to scale walls which would seem impassable for humanoid species.

# Effects

You can easily climb steep natural terrain, even up to `90Â°`. More difficult climbs, like overhangs, wet rocks, or metal walls are slightly easier for you too.
