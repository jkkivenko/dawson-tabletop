#WIP #animalistic 

# Prerequisites

[[Bubble]]

# Description

Your air bubbles are coated in thick mucus, granting them resistance against popping and deflecting some attacks.

# Effects

Your Bubble no longer pops when anything enters or leaves it, reforming in its place instead. If a Kinetic attack would penetrate the bubble, the Bubble grants the target of the attack a `+10%` Evasion chance.
