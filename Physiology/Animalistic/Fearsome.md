#WIP #animalistic

# Prerequisites

Hardened

# Description

Your toughened exterior is enough to make enemies think twice about attacking you. You've figured out how to use this hesitation to your advantage.

# Effects

You gain the following:

## Reaction: Fearsome Glare

**Trigger: An enemy attacks you or uses an ability that allows you to Evade, and you have not used Fearsome Glare against this target in the last day.**

You psych out your enemies, causing them to briefly lose their confidence. You gain a `+15%` Evasion chance against the triggering effect, but only once.
