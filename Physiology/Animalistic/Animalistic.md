# Description

Animalistic species have features indicating their evolutionary past: hardened claws, armour plates, keen eyes, gills, or the propensity to run on all fours. Despite these features, Animalistic species are not animals. They are bipedal, sentient, capable of speech, and have opposable thumbs. When you choose this Physiology, decide which specific animalistic features your Character has so you can pick corresponding Physiology Tree Abilities when you level up.

Whether they resemble a common animal seen on Earth or a totally alien creature, Animalistic species tend to be viewed as barbaric or less-than-sentient by certain bigots across the galaxy. However, they are just as capable as any other species - members of Animalistic species might be well-suited as Gunners because of their physical prowess, use their keen eyesight and sense of direction as a Pilot, or use their fearsome presence as Commanders.
