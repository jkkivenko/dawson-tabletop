#WIP #animalistic

# Prerequisites

[[Patterned]]

# Description

With focus and dedication, your species can change the colours on their bodies for camouflage or communication.

# Effects

You gain the following:

## Action: Camouflage

You focus on your body, changing your colour to hide among the patterns surrounding you. When standing still, this grants you a `+25%` Evasion chance. However, if you have made a noticeable movement in the last 10 seconds, this bonus drops to `+10%`.

This effect lasts until you leave the environment in which you used Colour Change, up to your GM. You can also dismiss this effect whenever you like.

## Action: Fade

You become translucent, although your outline, eyes, and clothes can still be seen. For the next `20 seconds`, you gain a `+6%` Evasion chance.

## Passive: Chameleon Communication

By changing your colours, you can choose to make your communications more clear. The range of your Patterned Communication increases to `75m`. You can also choose to change your colour or pattern into one of your choosing, potentially useful for entertainment or sending coded messages.
