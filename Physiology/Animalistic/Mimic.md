# Prerequisites

Chameleon

# Description

Having spent your life studying non-Patterned creatures, you can even change your body to resemble someone else.

# Effects

You gain the following action:

## Action: Mimic

You focus on your body, changing your looks and pattern to become unrecognisable. You can choose to impersonate someone you've seen before or a become completely fictional person. In any case, your voice does not change and you cannot Mimic someone who has extra limbs or a significantly different body shape.

If you choose to impersonate someone you've seen before, you have a `95%` Evasion chance to pass yourself off as them by looks alone. However, those who know your target well might be able to tell you're someone else based on your voice, mannerisms, and knowledge. 

If you choose a fictional person, you become completely unrecognisable. However, your voice might still give you away.
