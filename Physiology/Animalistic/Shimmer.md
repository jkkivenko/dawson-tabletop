# Prerequisites

Bioluminescent

# Description

Through meditation or a natural talent, you have fine control over the lights on your body.

# Effects

You gain the Shimmer action. 

## Action: Shimmer

You focus on your skin, controlling your bioluminescent patterns. Choose one of the following effects:

**Shine**
Your body glows brightly, lighting up a `20m` radius brightly for the next `30 seconds`.

**Suppress**
Your lights flicker out, causing you to temporarily lose your Bioluminescent effects which rely on your skin patterns. This effect lasts until you dismiss it.

**Switch**
You cause your lights to blink or otherwise show a specific pattern for the next `30 seconds`.
