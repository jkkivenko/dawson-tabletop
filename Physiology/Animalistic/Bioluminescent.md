#WIP #animalistic 

# Prerequisites

[[Patterned]]

# Description

Your patterns glow faintly, allowing you to light up dark regions and be seen from afar. 

# Effects

Your skin patterns always glow, lighting up a `10m` radius with dim fluctuating light. Additionally, you can be seen even from outside that radius, allowing you to use Patterned Communication in the dark.

These effects can be temporarily suppressed by covering your patterns with clothing, but your skin still glows even if you're unconscious.
