# Prerequisites

[[Winged Training]]

# Description

You use your wings for protection as well as movement.

# Effects

You gain Wing Shield.

## Action: Wing Shield

You stretch out your full wingspan, granting cover for yourself and those around you. Up to 4 willing targets within `2m` of you are covered by your wings, becoming impossible to target. All attempts to target your covered allies instead target you. 

If a protected target leaves your `2m` radius, they return to normal. Wing Shield can be dismissed at any time.
