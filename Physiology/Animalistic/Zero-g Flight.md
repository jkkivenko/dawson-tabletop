# Prerequisites

Winged Training

# Description

Your wings, although not capable of lifting your body in regular gravity, can easily carry you in low-g environments.

# Effects

Through careful wing usage, you gain the ability to fly when gravity isn't at its worst. You gain Zero-g Flight.

## Passive: Zero-g Flight

You can fly, but only in environments where your body weighs less. If you're experiencing less than `40%` gravity, you can fly using your full Speed in any direction.
