#WIP #animalistic 

# Prerequisites

[[Ink Jet]]
[[Bioluminescent]]

# Description

Your body is a mystery to science. Luckily for you, you don't need to know science to shoot bioluminescent ink on command.

# Effects

Your Spout action loses the Ink effect but gains the Dazzle effect. Additionally, you can spend one action to shoot harmless bioluminescent ink, lighting up a dark area.

### Dazzle

An attack with Dazzle blinds the target with bioluminescent ink. On a successful hit, the target becomes Dazzled. A Dazzled target whose vision relies on visual light cannot see at all until the start of the attackers next turn or until they spend one action to wipe the ink from their eyes, whichever happens last.
