# Prerequisites

[[Animalistic]]

# Description

Your most recent evolutionary ancestor used patterns for communication or display - a bright butterfly, a bird with complex feathers, a chameleon, or some other creature whose looks were very important. Whether your patterns are alluring, threatening, or confusing, they are unmistakeable.

# Effects

You gain the Patterned Communication passive.

## Passive: Patterned Communication

You have a deep understanding of the patterns on your body. You can unerringly communicate with another Patterned creature who can see you within `50m` using only the patterns on your body.

A non-Patterned creature can probably vaguely understand the emotions in your display, but does not necessarily know the content or intentions.
