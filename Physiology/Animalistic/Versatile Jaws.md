# Prerequisites

Bite

# Description

Your strong jaws are not only weapons, they are also a tool which you can use to carefully hold objects and allies like tiny kittens.

# Effects

You can choose to make your Bite attack deal no damage. As always, willing targets can choose to be hit by your attack, removing the need for Accuracy and Evasion.
