# Prerequisites

Large Lungs

# Description

Using your large reserve of air, you can blow a bubble to assist air-breathers underwater.

# Effects

You gain the Bubble action. 

## Action: Bubble

**Requirement: You have more than 1 minute of air remaining.**

You blow a bubble of air, encapsulating you and up to 4 allies within `2m` of you. You and your encapsulated allies can breathe normally for 30 seconds. However, when Bubble ends, your air amount becomes 1 minute less than your air amount before you used Bubble.

If anyone enters or leaves the radius, or if an attack penetrates through the bubble, the bubble pops and the effect ends.
