# Prerequisites

[[Aqua Jet]]

# Description

Though your internal organs puzzle doctors, you find them quite useful. You can shoot out a jet of ink to blind and confuse enemies.

# Effects

Your Spout action gains the Ink effect.

### Ink

An attack with Ink blinds the target with thick ink. On a successful hit, the target becomes Inked. An Inked target whose vision relies on visual light cannot see at all. An Inked target can spend one action to wipe the ink clear of their eyes, although their clothes will likely be stained for much longer.
