#WIP 

A Character in Dawson is determined by two broad categories: their Ancestry and their Capabilities. 

# Ancestry

Unlike other systems which have a limited number of playable species, Dawson takes place in a massive galaxy with an uncountable number of intelligent species to play. For this reason, Dawson does not make you choose from a pre-decided list of Ancestries. Instead, Characters can each have their own unique Ancestry, potentially allowing for a crew in which no members are exactly alike.

A Character's Ancestry is a combination of their [[Society]] and their [[Physiology]]. These broadly correspond to what kind of world they were raised on, and what species they are. When creating a Character, choose a Society and Physiology and design your alien race from there. If you prefer, you can play as one of the example Ancestries in the Dawson galaxy or use them as inspiration for an alien Ancestry of your design. When you gain Society Tree Points or Physiology Tree Points, allocate them to the trees outlined in your chosen Society and Physiology.

| Example Ancestry | Description | Society | Physiology |
|---|---|---|---|
| Humans | A race evolved from primates, originally from Earth, who spread out far and wide across the Milky Way after they discovered FTL travel. | Any, but usually Adaptable | Humanoid |
| Arapaima | A race of fish-like people from the water-world Anomura who lived primitive agrarian lives until visited by Malachites. After studying the Malachite technology, they were suddenly catapulted into the space age and as such they have some quirks that other species might find unsavoury. | Reclusive or Communal | Animalistic (aquatic) |
| Malachites | A race of four-legged four-armed beings originally from Malachi, a desert world. After their planet became unlivable due to a runaway greenhouse effect, many of them took to the stars searching for a new world to settle on - or conquer. | Warlike or Adaptable | Many-limbed (legs and arms) |
| Androids | Humans, Malachites, Tellurians, and countless other Ancestries across the galaxy have invented Androids to help in manual tasks or simply in the pursuit of science. Some Androids resent the creators they toil under while others have been granted freedom to do as they please. | Adaptable or that of their creator's Ancestry | Synthetic |
| Bel | A seldom-seen race of secretive telepaths from the planet Belmont. The Bel have latent psychic powers which can be awakened through meditation so they prefer to keep to themselves in the pursuit of self-realisation instead of exploring the galaxy. | Reclusive | Psychic (any, but usually telepathy) |
| Tellurians | A psychic race which puts a focus on self-expression and fulfillment. They come from the planet Telluria in the same system as the Bel, which leads some exo-historians to believe they share a common ancestor. | Artful | Psychic |
| Chiti | A race which tends to remind Humans of ants. They come from a planet they simply call "Home" where they live in large co-dependent cities. Though not a literal hive mind, Chiti tend to stick close to their allies and never make decisions without consulting them first. | Communal | Animalistic (hardened)

Usually, members of the same species have the same Physiology and probably have the same Society. However, this is not always the case. Humans, for example, are remarkably differentiated. There have been Humans of all Societies on Earth throughout history, even at the same time. Indeed, members of the same species need not even share the same Physiology - a Human who underwent the Evening Trial on Belmont might become Psychic, or a Tellurian with a fascination for prosthetics might be Synthetic. 

## Multiple Societies or Physiologies

In some cases it might make sense for a Character to come from multiple Societies or to have multiple Physiologies. This is usually unadvisable during Character creation because it might overwhelm players with options, but experienced players might ask their GMs for permission to do so. Additionally, in cases like those described above, GMs might give out Society or Physiology Tree Points which can be allocated into a Society or Physiology Tree that not match the Ancestry chosen by the players. These can offer interesting rewards for players and will likely not upset the balance of the game too much because low-level Tree Point investment does not offer particularly powerful rewards at high levels of play.

# Capabilities

A Character's Capabilities represent what a Character has trained to do, either from their backstory or from levelling up in the game. Their Capabilities probably determine what they do during a regular day, from scavenging broken Warp Reactors to keeping peace between warring planets.

A Character's Capabilities are a combination of their [[Class]] and their [[Skills]]. Their Class represents what they spend most of their time doing, and might even represent their profession or hobby. On the other hand, a Character's Skills are more nuanced personality traits and personal fascinations that help them out or change how they interact with the world. When designing a Character, pick a Class from the list one Skill to start. When you gain Class Tree Points, allocate them to the Class Tree outlined in your chosen Class. Skill Tree Points, unlike the other three types of Tree Points, are not restricted by a Class, Society, or Physiology. Any Character can choose to allocate points anywhere on the Skill Tree as long as they meet the requirements.

# Tree Points

When you reach a new level, you gain the points listed in that level's entry on the table below. You can immediately allocate those points into their corresponding trees, or allocate them at any time later on.

| Level | Class Tree Points Gained| Society Tree Points Gained | Physiology Tree Points Gained | Skill Tree Points Gained |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1  | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 2  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| 3  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 4  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 5  | 2 | 1 |   | 1 |
| 6  | 2 |   | 1 | 1 |
| 7  | 2 |   |   | 1 |
| 8  | 2 |   | 1 | 1 |
| 9  | 2 |   |   | 1 |
| 10 | 3 |   | 1 | 1 |

## Optional Rule: Re-specialisation

Sometimes players might want to respec their points if they realise they made a mistake early on in their Character's design or simply don't like how their Character feels. If it isn't too consequential, the GM might simply allow this to happen, or they might require some time for the Character to retrain. Generally, Character's can't respec their Physiology and Society Tree Points except in rare circumstances.
