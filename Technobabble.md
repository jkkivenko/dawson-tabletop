# Description

Technobabble is an umbrella term for any word, solution, problem, or description which relies on futuristic gibberish. It is a key part of the [[Core Tenets|Core Tenet]] of [[Core Tenets#1. Camp|Camp]], which encourages games not to take themselves too seriously.

For example, imagine a ship were investigating a stellar remnant of a supernova which just calmed down. Upon scanning with their [[Gravimetric Sensor]], they discover a gravitational anomaly which seems to be increasing the effect of gravity on nearby vessels and planets.

Of course, none of this follows the modern understanding of science, nor does it even make sense considering what one might expect to happen after a supernova, but it [[Core Tenets#2. Raising the Stakes|Raises the Stakes]] and allows for GMs to introduce wacky situations like increased gravity on a starship bridge.

In this sense, Technobabble is mostly harmless and only exists to provide plot hooks to Dawsoneers. However, there is another way Technobabble can be used and it is one which has a much more profound impact on the game: [[#Invoking Technobabble]].

## A Note on Technobabble (In)Consistency

Often, GMs and Dawsoneers might find themselves in a situation where their previous Technobabble contradicts its current usage. Try to avoid this if possible, but Technobabble is by its very nature nonsense. Remember that Dawson is [[Core Tenets#1. Camp|Campy]] and shouldn't be taken too seriously.

Importantly, Invoking Technobabble does not "change the rules of the game". If Technobabble was Invoked to supercharge a sensor with tachyon particles, that doesn't mean that a constant source of tachyons will allow sensors to always operate at longer ranges. Technobabble is temporary, unpredictable, dangerous, and probably voids the warranty on your starship. Don't expect it to work a second time!

# Invoking Technobabble

Dawsoneers can, when they see fit, Invoke Technobabble. In order to do this, they must say a long string of scientific-sounding gibberish (in character!), usually summing it up with a clean metaphor or simple explanation. This is a sacred God-given right granted to all Dawsoneers, so others must respect the Technobabble and all that goes along with it.

When one Invokes Technobabble and finishes explaining themselves, they can reap the rewards. The GM adjudicates what happens, but at the very least it usually has some kind of percentage success rate determined by the GM. On a success, the Technobabble works! The fermion pulse disables the communications tower, the ship escapes the black hole's pull by detonating an implosion torpedo just inside its event horizon (just like plugging a hole in a tire!), or the ship hides inside the ionic gas cloud to confuse the sensors of a distant probe. 

Whatever the case, it's not quite over yet. When Technobabble is Invoked, whether or not it succeeds, there is always a secondary effect: Either the [[Core Tenets#2. Raising the Stakes|Stakes are Raised]] or there is some [[Core Tenets#3. Give and Take|Give and Take]]. This is up to the GM, and if there has already been a lot of Give and Take then they might decide this condition has already been satisfied, but in general Technobabble is never without consequence. For example, a fermion pulse might successfully disable communications towers, but it also renders ion-based engines (the kind the crew happens to be using) completely ineffective! By Raising the Stakes, GMs can encourage Dawsoneers not to abuse Technobabble to solve every problem.
